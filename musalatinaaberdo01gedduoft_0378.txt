lt follows that the only two volumes which the Council
can report as issued since the date of last Genera] Meeting are:
1.—T111-: lN‘IlscELLANv oi· Tui: NEw SPALmNo CLUss. Vol. Ι.
(Pp. lxii. -μ 391, with 32 pp. of Club ReportS.)
11.—T111‹; Amas or BANFF. Edited by ,william Cramond,
MA. Vol. I. (Pp. xv. -ι- 385, with nine plateS.)

The former volume constituted the second half of the issue
for the year 1890. The latter constitutes the first instalment
of the issue for the year 1891. The second instalment—the
volume of the Chartulary—will be distributed to members at
the earliest possible date; but, owing to the circumstances
above detailed, it will fall for delivery within the year 1892, so
that the balance will be redressed by the issue of three volumes.
if all goes well, within that year. The Council feel extreme
regret at having to make such an announcement, but having
regard to the nature of his materials. they recognise the severity
of the task of co—ordination which has fallen to Mr. Cooper‚ a
task, however, which he is anxious to perform with all the
more care and elaboration‚ inasmuch as the work is one so
intimately connected with the civic and historic development of
Aberdeen. The Council trust that the Club will make every
allowance for delays arising in connection with editorial work
undertaken‚ solely in the interests of the Club, by gentlemen
whose intervals of leisure are but few.

As approved by the Editorial Committee the issues properly
belonging to the year 1892 will be :—

L-Tmz ANNALS 012 BANFF. Vol. ΙΙ.

II.—MUSA LATINA ABERDONENSls (as described in last
Report). Edited by Principal Geddes. Vol. I.:
being the Parerga of Arthur Johnston. With illus-
trative portraits by jamesone and others, reproduced
in photogravure.
