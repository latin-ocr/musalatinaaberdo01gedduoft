184 PARERGA.

Ante tuas acies Tamesis metuebat, et Ister,
Impatiensque iugi Rhenus, et ipse Tybris.
Et Phaethonteas gens quae circumcolit undaS,
Et Ligur, et Tuscus, finitimique duces. 50
Teque tuis populis, et gesa minantia gesis
Vidimus: horret adhuc mens meminisse nefas.
Martia Fergusidum gens de tot millibus una
Militiae nunquam fulmine tacta tuae est.
Illa tuis semper, nullo discrimine, coeptis
Favit, et una salus, unus et hostis erat.
Bella domi quoties pro te cum gente propinqua
Miscuit, in clades ingeniosa suas?
Externo quoties hostem quaesivit in orbe?
Quot tibi Parrhasio misit ab axe duces? 60
Longa foret series: de multis sufficit unus,
Hic qui Baugiacos sanguine mersit agros.
Hic tibi Grampigenae comitatus robore gentis
Adfuit, externo cum premerere iugo.
Sola tibi Biturix domini parebat habenis;
Cetera cum populis hostica terra fuit.

49. Phaethonteas aquas] i.e., waters of the Po, alluding to the classical legend of the
Po in Lombardy.

60. Parrhasia] i.e.‚ Norfflern, Boreal clime. It signifies properly “ Arcadian,” Callisto,
the Arcadian nymph, being changed into the northern constellation of the Great Bear.

62. Baugiacos.] The battle of Bauge in Anjou was fought on March 23, 1421 (Scott's Lay
of tlte Last Mlnstrcl, V. 4 n.). Scots and French there defeated and slew Clarence, brother
to the English King, Henry V., and Sir Alex. Buchanan is credited with the exploit (Brown's
Lifi¹ of Georgc Buchanan, p. 6). The Scots were led by John Stewart‚ Earl of Buchan‚¹ second
son os the Scottish Regem, Robert, Duke of Albany, and so grandson of Robert 11. Plura in
Michel's Ecossais, 1. 116-203 Dr. Davidson‘s Garioch, pp. 106-7; in Sir R. Douglas's Pecrage,
1. 2663 also charming account in J. H. Burton’s Scot Abroad, 1. 35. It is interesting to note
that our historian‚ Burton, makes out a strong case sor King Robert Bruce and the Scots as
having, by the victory of Bannockburn and all its sequels‚ saved western Europe from an
all-subduing empire and dynasty of the Plantagenets.

65. Biturix] Bourges, the central city, as in Caesar's time, and cstadel, of France.
Charles VII. of France, in his missortunes, was nicknamed “ King os Bourges‚'‘ to which for a
time his dorninion was reduced (Kitchin's History os Francc, chap. vi.).
