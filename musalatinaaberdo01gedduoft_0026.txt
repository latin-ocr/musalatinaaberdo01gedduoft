xvi INTRODUCTION TO THE PARERGA OF ARTHUR JOHNSTON.

leisure in a short and busy life to produce so many compositions
of skill and distinguished merit. As ‘⁴ Medicus Regius‚‘’ Arthur
Johnston could have had but little spare time to elaborate, and
the extensive range of his verse, as well as its high quality, seem
to indicate that he had an almost Ovidian facility in rolling off
the Elegiae couplets in which he excelled. Dr. Pitcairne‚ in last

was an elegant Classical composer, neither of them presents a
name at all comparable either in mass of production or power
of versification to the “ Medicus Regius '' of the previous century.

some historical interest :—

1. The series of poems bearing on the outbreak of the*

Thirty Yeais' War and the fortunes of the Princess

Elizabeth, the Queen of Bohemia (Nos. VI., VII.,

that volcano arc vivid and enlivening. From his place of

and the Palatinate‚ ancl one feels that his earnest appeals for
aid in behalf of the Princess anticipate‚ in 'a manner, the tone
of a “special correspondent ⁷⁷ transported back to the times of
'silly and Gustavus. Besides the three poems above referred
to, there is the interesting one (No. XXXVI.) to the Princess
Elizabeth's brother—in-law‚ who had been passing through his
educational course at Sed-an, and from this we gather a lively
