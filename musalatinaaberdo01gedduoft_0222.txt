XXVIII. ΟΝ THE RUPTURE OF THE PEACE BETWEEN
FRANCE AND SCOTLAND.¹

ELEGY II.

After the union of the crowns in 1603, Scotland could not now escape being drawn into
the anti-French side of continental politics through its connection with her bigger sister,
England. The war against France here deplored was that undertaken in July, 1626, when
Buckingham was in the ascendant and made that hapless expedition to Rochelle and the Isle
of Rhe. It lasted till May, 1629. In 1639, however, in the agony of the “Covenanff’
Rothes Loudoun and others appealed to Louis XIII. in virtue of the old alliance. See

Masson's Drummond, p. 156 ; R. Chambers' D. A.‚ ΙΙ. Ι3; Gordon’s Scots Affairs‚ ΙΙΙ. pp. 7-8
(Spalding Club).

ARGUMENT.

Any portent may now occur: stass may lose their light, firths their
tributary waves‚ and streams run up hill-ward; France and the sons of Fer-
gus are at war ! The royal shades of Achaius and Charles the Great(Char1e-
magne) will groan to hear. The White Lilies and the Red Lion are severed.
Why this change? ’Twas France that began to violate British ships, whence
came the seizure of the Isle of Rhe'. Would that that isle had sunk in the
Atlantic wave‚ an‘d that Scylla had swallowed up the barks‚ built as they must
have been and rigged in the groves of the Furies rather than in the pine forests
of Caledonia. Over eight centuries has the alliance lasted; now 'tis broken by

a fickle race. What is the cause of thy change, Ο France? Has any enehant— v
ress been at work with spells? The Moor, the Spaniard, the Fleming, the ἶ
German, thy neighbours to the* East, have felt thy might. Ere now the J
Tharnes and Danube, the Rhine‚ and eke the Tiber did stand in awe of thee, and .

Lombardy‚ Genoa, and Tuscany dreaded thy spear. Never till now have the
sons of Fergus suffered from thy thunderbolts of war, for Scotia always ,
