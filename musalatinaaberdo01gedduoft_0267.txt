Goon WISHEs THE HIGH AND MIGHTY PRINCE Lunvro,
COUNT PALATmE, DUKE OF BAVAR1A‚ ETc.

This poem, in honour os the brother of Frederick the Elector Palatine (see under No.
V1.), is full of reminiscences of Sedan, where the two princes had been educated. This Lud-
vig‚ born at Heidelberg 22nd November, 1602, is heard of at his brother's court at Heidelberg,
and also at Prague in the time of their shortlived prosperity <Benger’s Mcmoirs of thc Primi-ess
Elizabcth)‚ KhevenhilIer, VIII. p. 252. This poem is found in ed. 1632.

ARGUMENT.

Arcturus is now in the ascendant, and Aries will soon bear the coursers
i of the sun. ’Tis the season of spring, of bland Zephyrs, and rich carpetings
of colour‚ songs of birds and gambols of all animated creatures. But how
soon comes a change! To-morrow there will be no trace of joyous spring,
Thou, O Ludvig! sprung from celestial seed, favourite of the world, to
whom Rhine and Neckar yield their homage, art about to leave us, and all
joys will emigrate with thee. Our flowers will follow thee, and the German
clime will pluck the roses of Sedan. Why rob the river Meuse of its joy?
This city [Sedan] reared thee from tender years: it hospitised thy brother.
It seeks no reward for rearing thee, save only to gaze on the face of a Prince
Ι Palatine. 'Tis small in size, but great in fame; Mars directs it, and the
renown of the Dukes of Bouillon is its protecting shield. The Spaniard has
been foiled by it, and to its prowess martial France has owed its safety.
Along with Mars the Muses flourish. Tilenus, like a second Chiron, forms
young heroes by Aonian themes. There is the race-course, where De la Tour
triumphs. If, again, Diana and the chase attract a youth's desires, there
are happy hunting fields around. There are dances and delight‚ where
Maria de la Tour presides, and a tendet spirit of Love is breathing around.
Flowers laugh on every hand. But Ι in vain whip up Phoebus’ car. Thou
preparest to depart‚ a Pollux to join thy brother Castor. The Caledonian
Princess Elizabeth [Electress Palatine‘2]‚ again a mother, has blest thy brother
with one who is to thee a golden nephew, for whom high destinies are pre-
pared. Go, hie thee to thy fatherland, but may the Powers soon, with the
same celerity‚ restore thee back again.
