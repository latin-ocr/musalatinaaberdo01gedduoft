VIII. THE NYMPH OF THE NECKAR TO THE HEROES
OF ENGLAND.

Like Nos. VI. and VII., this poem appeared also in a separate sorm, but without date
of year, although with ‘⁴ Heidelbergae '’ on title-page. On this there is a device, which
may be thus described: Two figures of snake-footed giants, each holding a branch, are
seated back to back, and on their shoulders rests an urn with certain letters thus arranged :—

G G
F.

The urn is surmounted by flames and a Bird with upsoaring wings rising out of thern,
Phoenix-like. Scroll around the flames: “ Semper Eaedem '’. Above the Bird’s head a
scroll with words :—

“ De la mia Morte Eterna vita io vivo”.

(This device and the ornamentation os heading before the poem are identical with those
used in the 1620 edition of previous poem, a circumstance which fixes the date also of this
(undated) poem in its separate form.)

The key to the interpretation of the poem is found in the fact that
Heidelberg, the capital of the Palatinate, is on the Neckar, Latin Nicer,
whence Nicrina, which therefore stands for ‘⁴ Nymph (or City) of the Neckar ''.
(Latent in the word is the root of Nix and Nicker, a kind of water Elves or
Spirits in Teutonic mythology.)

Very acute was the situation caused by the disasters of the Elector Palatine. These
disasters he himself foreboded, for “as he (Coxe's Austrizz, 2·168) signed the act of electiori
to Bohemia with a trembling hand, he bedewed it with his tears‚'' but Elizabeth, his
consort, bravely urged him on : and the result was that his feeble graspiug at the Bohemian
crown led to his losing his own Palatinate. In 1620 a court-dependent at London
writes: “ We had a short and quick alarrn here at the first news of Spinola's entering upon

the Palatinate‚ and it troubled the king [James I.] awhile3 yet the Baron Dhena [envoy of j

the Prince Palatine] could not persuade him to intermit his sports, and enter into some
serious consideration of the business, protesting he did not know whether his Master [the
elector] at that hour had one foot of land left in those parts '⁷.¹ (Nichols’ Progr„ IV. 617.)
