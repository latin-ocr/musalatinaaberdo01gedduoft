8 ARTHUR JOHNSTON.

ΙΙ. INSCRIPTIONS TO THE NINE MUSES.

ADDRESSED TO SCOT OF SCOTSTARVET.

Besides the Prose Dedication of the ‘⁴ Delitiae,'' Scotstarvet received the honour of Nine
Elogia to the Muses inscribed with his name, and all from the pen of Arthur Johnston.

Ι.. URANIA.

The dark north now gleams with starS, once concealed by mists and
shadows of the polar sky. 'Tis a Scot¹ that dispels the darkness, and, by
lending light to these starS, is partner with Phoebus in shedding his effulgent
rays.

2. EUTERPE.

Here, by Scot's hand gathered, are seen the luminaries of the land of
Fergus, buried in mists erewhile. The northern sky is lit up with constella-
tions, and Scotia underneath partakes in their effulgence. These, however,
do not shine on all the world, but the stars of the Caledonian race shine
everywhere.

3. CALLIOPE.

To many northern bards the brave Scotstarvet has given life and light.
Soon as he displays these to the world, a crowd of poem, once admired, are
thrown into the shade. The same right hand that gives life to countless

poets, slays as many.
4. THALIA.

This age has seen the flowem, laden with ambrosial nectar, poured forth
by French and by Italian soil. Here we perceive those borne by a land
beneath Bootes, a land, even under the dogstar‚ wrapt in feathery snow. The
land, producing those, has the merit of fertility; the land, producing these,
can claim industrious culture as its meed.

¹ This is the frequent jest of the Renaissance ages, turning on the accidental resemblance
of Scot to σκότος, signisying darkness Hence the famous compliment to Buchanan: οὐ
σκότος εῑ, ἀλλὰ φάος Euo-rins: also Dansken (Delitq 1. 303), “alluxisti Scotis: nox atra re-
cessit ”. Scotland has suffered much from this bad pun : the quantity oso in Scotus ought to
have protected her. The jest appears in Epigrams on Thomas Dempster, Scottis (Hist. Eccl.
in Presace) 3 D. Camerarius de statii, etc.; on tomb of the Scots exile, Conaeus, at Rome, who
was destined for the Cardinalate, φῶς ἐν τῆ Σκοτίᾳ φαίνει, giving a double meaning to St. John.
Ev. Ι. 5 (Collections ⁰f Spalding Club, p. 474). One of the most absurdly delicious things
under this head was the epigram os Dr. James Duport‚ the famous Grecian of Cambridge, who
brushes away the pun as unpleasant to King James, and produces a counter pun as absurd,
how James came from, ‘⁴ Albania,'' or Albyn, and reminds us how “ Albus ut obscuro deterget
