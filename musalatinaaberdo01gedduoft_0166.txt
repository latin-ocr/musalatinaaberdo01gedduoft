XXI. APOLOGY FOR THE MIDWIFE [THAUMANTIA]‚ AD-
DRESSED TO THE TOWN COUNCIL OF ABERDEEN.

(Appears in Editions of ‘32 and '37.—James Brzwe’s abstract of this poem
may be compared, as found on pp. 184-5 of “ Eminent Men osAberdeen ”.)

Humorous protest against purting into the lockup-house‚ as had been done, so useful
and necessary a member of society. The heroine of the appea1, who appears to have
incurred penalties for scurrilous or bad language, has escaped all research, and our local

“Apologia pro Lena ''.

ARGUMENT.

August Council, Ι have to protest, and hereby take instruments or arms
such as ye see and learn. Love of my native soil compels. The pious
Trojan (Aeneas) started up from liis couch to defend his country when in a

reap, of planting vines or apple-trees, if there is none to pull the grapes
and apples ? Who, in mid Ocean, would prefer accident to art? Not more

quicksands are in the Ocean than there are dangers at childbirth: heel is ’

sometimes kicking where head should be, as in Nero's birth from
Agrippina's womb. Sometimes the midwife must take the knife and
perform the Caesarean operation, as witness Caesar, the glory of the Roman
tace, and Manlius; yea and also [Scipio] the destroyer of the Libyan name.
Even in the realm of Gods the art of the midwife is not unknown. Witness
Latona‘s throes, and Jupiter's pangs at Pallas' birth. His midwife was Mul-
ciber (Vulcan) with his skull-cleaving hatchet. What would Jove have given
for the old dame now languishing in prison? She would have been a
godsend, a welcome help, needing no harsh weapon to give relief. Who
can tell her services, in the region near where Dee and Don mingle
their waters in the main? ’Tis enough to mention one good case: My
wife and a child Ι owe to her. My Paeonian craft was all in vain; but not
