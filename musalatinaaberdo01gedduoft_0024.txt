knighthood conseri-ed on him by Charles Ι. at the Coronation ceremonies, which he
attended as Provost of Aberdeen, 1633. He seems to have been an attached personal
friend of Jamesone‘S, and lent him his powerful support. (Bulloch.)

PORTRMT OF JonN GORDON‚ V1scotJNT MELGUM, who perished in the Fire
of Frendraught. Tosace p. 294.
Through the courteous permission of His Grace the Duke of Richmond
and Gordon, KG„ this picture was obtained from the original which is

by Jamesone at Gordon Castle.

A youngish man, a hals-length in steel armour. He was the second son of the first
Marquis of Huntly. This portrait derives much interest from the circumstance that the
subject of it was one of the victims who was burnt to death in the House of Frendraught
on the 18th October [N.S.], 1630. He was married to Lady Sophia Hay, a daughter of
the Earl of Erroll. (Bulloch.)

PORTRAIT OF S1R JAMEs CRICHTON oF FRENDRAUGHT (died 1636).
To face p. 296.
Through the courtesy of Colonel Morison of Bognie, this and the
following picture were obtained from the originals which are by
Jamesone‚ now at Montblairy‚ Banffshire.

Inscribed, “Anno 1634 AEtatis 36'’. This is presumably the Laird of Frendraught
in whose day Frendraught Castle was burned in September, 1630.

This picture has been slightly tampered with. The sace has been at least varnished
out, and the lace collar repainted in an inferior manner. The dress of black stuff, slashed
with white silk, has not been touched. Sir James is a very plain, low-browed, rather
sad-visaged gendeman, and if the suspect on account of the Frendraught tragedy, was at
this very time undergoing much trouble on account of it. (Bulloch.)

Pomm OF ELIZABETH GORDON, WIFE oF S1R JAMEs CRICHTON OF
FRENDRAUGHT. To face p. 298.

Inscribed, “Anno 1637 AEtatis 34’'. This picture has also been slightly tampered
with-it remains, however, substantially as Jamesone lest it. The hair is brought over
the brow in a series of detached fringes or curls with a good effect, and a dark snood or
veil partly covers the head, falling gracefully down the lady's back. A very large and
particularly rich lace collar reaches from the neck, leaving only a long narrow stripe of
the breast exposed. A stately handsome picture.

She was the beautiful daughter of the Earl of Sutherland‚ and nearly related to the
Marquis of Huntly‚ to whom she went the morning after the burning of Frendraught.
This pathetic incident is caresully related by Spalding, who says ‘⁴ that upon the morn,
after this woeful fite, the lady Frendraught, buskit in a white plaid, and riding on a
small nag, having a boy leading her horse, without any more in her company—in this
pitisul manner she came weeping and mourning to the Bog [now Gordon Castle] desiring
to speak with my Lord; but this was refused, so she returned back to her own house,
the same gate she carne, comfortless ''. (Bulloch.)
