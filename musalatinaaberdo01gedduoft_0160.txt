XVIII. To THE RIGHT REVV. NICOLAS DU FIEF AND
PHILIP JONART, RIGHT HONOURABLE COUNSEL-
LORS OF THE COURT OF MALINES.

Short biographies of these are found in the MS. Histoire du Grand Conso-il de Malines
(now in the Archive-room at Brussels). Both were churchmen and canons os Tournay, and
Du Fies was ultimately designated Bishop of Artas, but, owing to the Freneh aggressi0n‚
never accepted the position, because he would not change his allegiance to the representatives

os the House of Burgundy. The following is an extract from the inscription on his tomb at
Tournay as given in that MS. :—

Aeternae memoriae Reverendissimi Domini Nicolai du Fies Atrebatensis Episcopi
designati Qui in supremam Mechliniae curiam adlectus Regi Patriae per annos xx. pari
prudentia et laude ut sidus eluxit.—He died 21st Oct.‚ 1651. Philippe Jonart was a native of
Mons, became canon of Tournay, and was raised by the Archdukes Albert and Isabella to be
a member of the ‘⁶ Grand Conseil de Malines‚’' a position which he filled from 1620 to 1632,
when he retired to his native town Mons and died in 1634.

ARGUMENT.

Both of you are friends indeed, who have sustained a Caledonian’s cause.-
Ι approach you with grateful thanks. The god Terminus holds his own
beside high Jove. Like the great Twin Brethren ye are to me ; and Castor and
Pollux had between them but one altar. To return an equal favour would be a
work for a Hercules. All gists as tokens of gratitude are vain. Bulls offered
at the altar vanish in smoke‚ but my affection for you twain has no bounds or
end. My own resources have been clrained: Ι can yield no present. As for
gold of India or the Tagus, the mob may covet it; not so ye. If Ι think of
gifts of song with Calliope taking up her harp, Apollo frowns and says : “Why
bring marble to Paroa or roses to Paestum? Castalia is already theirs.’'
The healing craft remahrs, a species of art that is useful ; but Ι trust you may

never need a physician’s aid. So my obligation Ι cannot pay, and must die
a debtor to you both.
