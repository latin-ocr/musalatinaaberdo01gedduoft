V. MAD ONOPORDUS.

(Same subject as in IV.)

A second attack on Eglishern for his insult to the Muse of Buchanan. The wealth of
classical allusion embroidered with odd fancies is remarkable; and Johnston refers later to
this youthfuljcu d'cspm'f, as will appear in No. XXXVIII. The poem first appeared in sepa·

ARGUMENT.

Ye doctors, Apollo’s band, why foolishly waste the physician's art? ‘Tis
all in vain to scour a brick or wash a nigger white. Sooner shall Nile flow

The ass will never unlearn to bray, or the dog to bark, the wolf to howl.
'Twas nature that ingrained the mischief, and the first bearn of life was the
first streak of madness. The furies presided at his conception, and held a
dark divan by Acheron, when Alecto breaks silence. “ Shall, then, thy off-
spring, Acheron, not know what Hymen means, nor call thee a grandsire?
We can dispense with the male, as juno once touched a flower and became a
mother independently of Jove. Venus sprang from the sea, Pallas from her
sire’s head, and the first fathers of mankind came from clay. Deucalion and
his wife got people out of stones; and dragons' teeth sprang up as men. The
warrior Myrmidons carne from ants. But to take an example out of a thou—
sand. Orion is a case in point—the child of the urine of three gods. Let us
imitate the example: there is the star for our bark to follow.’' Thus Alecto,
and so the sisters decreed. Says Tisiphone: “The moisture whence Orion
