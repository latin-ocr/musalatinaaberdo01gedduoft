218 PARERGA.

Per freta dum Priami victor ab urbe redit.
Nec generis lux illa tui, Sidneia narrat

Musa Pyrocleam plura tulisse ratem.
Maxime Pembmchi, rerum tutela mearum,

Per ‘tibi cessurum dirige vela fretum.
Non ego Ledaeos iuvenes in vota vocabo,

Nec vaga cum vili sidera plebe sequar. 70
Tu mihi Pollucis praestas et Castoris igneS‚

Et quae Graia ratis, quae Tyrus astra notat.
Tu mihi Neptuni frontem, tu nigra serenas

Aequora, quae votis non satis aequa queror.
Ancora tu, quoties vento quassatur iniquo,

Tu, quoties ventus deficit, aura rati es.
Fluctibus indomitis ubi fervent aequora, puppim,

Tiphys ut Aemonius, per vada caeca regis.
Denique, naufragiis cum passim tecta nigrescent

Caerula, tranquillus tu mihi portus eris. 80 Ῐ

Ut mihi, Maecenas, possis praestare, quod opto,
Det tibi Rex pelagi summus, et alma Thetis.

Ut praestare velis hoc, quod potes, aurea virtus,
Quaque praeis reliquis,¹ mens generosa dabit.

65. Sidneia Musa] A graceful allusion to Sir Philip Sidney, and his romanoe The
Conntcss of Pembrokc's Arcadia. If william (Third Earl) is the one addressec1, Sidney was

his uncle, as witness the famous “ Sidney's sister, Pembrokc's mothcr‚’' in Jonson‘s renowned . -’ἰ

Epitaph. He would sometimes, it is said, “ronse [grow warm]‚ to the trepidation of the King,

but kept in favour still ; for his majesty knew, plain dealing (as a jewel in all men so) was, in ' ¹

a Privy Counsellor‚ an ornamental duty''. In his younger days, when he was Lord Herbert‚
he had a penchant less acceptable to King James ; he was fond of tobacco ! “ Iopen a letter
from my Lord Harbert to me, who saies that he hath a continuall paine in his head, and finds
no manner of ease but by taking os tobacco. . . . You cannot send him a more pleasing
giste than excellent tobacc0.” (Whyte's Lcttcrs in Nichols' progresses ofKing Jamcs Ῑ., Vol.
Ι. 254.) Courtly and graceful mot of William, Earl of Pembroke, Nichols’ Progr.. ΙΙ. 208 ε dis· “

couraged the Spanish match. (Ibid.‚ IV. 886 n.) Glimpse oshim also in Chamberlain'slively ‚ r

letters (1st August, 1599) (Camd. Soc.) as zealous at court, “who shall sett the best legge
soremost ”. ·

71. Castoris ignes] The star Gemini, as protectors of sailors. Cf. St. Elmo's ⁴· lights ’'
