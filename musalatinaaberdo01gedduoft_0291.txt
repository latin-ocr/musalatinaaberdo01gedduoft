EPISTLE To ROBERT BARON. 249

XLI. TO ROBERT [BARONIUS] BARON.

N.B.-——-This and the subsequent poems in this volume, viz„ XLI.-LII., are not found
in edition of 1632, and appear first in Parerga of Delitiae or edition of 1637.

In 1617, during King James’s visit to St. Andrews, Robert Baron acquits himself,
scholastically‚ as the most subtle and elegant disputant (Nichols’ Progr., 3·366).

This Robert Baron (or Batonius 1) was probably, with the possible exception of John
Forbes of Corse, the most notable in intellect and learning of the group of famous
divines known as the “Aberdeen Doctors,'’ who were celebrated by Clarendon as resisting
the Covenant‚ and were complimented by King Charles in a special missive (Spald., Trubles,
Ι. 99). A younger son of the family of Kinnaird, in Fifeshire, he was a student of St.
Andrews, where, along with a brother‚2 he became a professor of Philosophy. As early
as King Jarnes's visit to St. Andrews in 1617, Robert Baron is, as remarked above,
protagonist in the Disputations held on the occasion (see also John Adamson's lec
Muses Welcome, ed. 1618). Attracting the notice of Bishop Patrick Forbes, he was
invited to succeed him as minister at Keith in 1618, and thereafter to fill the chair of
Divinity in Marischal College in 1625, becoming also one of the ministers of Aberdeen.
He was the author of various theological works in Latin (see p. 254); and receives
the tribute of this poem and XLIV„ as well as Nos. LXIV. and XCVII. (in Vol. 11.)
from the Muse of Johnston. Just before his death, he became Bishop-nominate of Orkney;
but, before officiating, he died in 1639 at Berwick, having “fied thither frae the Covenant‚''
so as to be outside Scotland. His works, which are theological and mostly in Latin, show him
to have been great in the fathers and schoolmen‚ but he does not disdain him whom he calls
“judicious and learned Calvine ’' (Funerals of Bishop Patrick Forbes, p. 65). Traces of him
in local records discouraging superstitious as to “sacred wells ” (Collatzbns, p. 253); as
receiving compliments and “ propynes '’ from the town of Aberdeen (Misa, Sp. Cl.‚ V. 101,
144, 145, 150). Among his papers was found a missive from Archbishop Laud, which probably
did Baton no good in his troubles (Spald., Trubles, I. 312). After the restoration in 1660 the
parliament remembered Baron and voted 24:200 to his relict and children (Funerals, etc„ p. 39).
Plura regarding him in Spalding pamm, Gordon's Scots Affairs, III. 235-8; and in Bulloch’s
Jamesone (whose child Baron baptised). Short Life also in Funcrals of Bishop Patrick
Forbes, p. 26; and notice of, by Cosmo Innes, in Fasti Aberd., p. xxxviii.

The Latin Muse of St. Andrews was as eloquent as that of Aberdeen in praise of
Baton. See Panter’s pair of epigrams, Funerals, etc.‚ p. 349. Baron’s theological doctrines
are impugned in a special treatise by Gul. Camerarius [Wm. Chalmers]‚ who, in a volume
printed at Paris in 1639 under the title of “Disputationes Theologicae‚⁷' directed against

11‘Basonius” as if in rivalry to the great historian of the Romish Church—Sir W.
Hamilton (Disc.‚ p. 192) calls him therefore the “ Scottish Batonius ’‘.
² Dr. John Baton, who conformed to the Covenant and became principal os St. Salvador⁷s.
