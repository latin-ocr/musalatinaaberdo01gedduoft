XLVII. ΟΝ VULTURNUS.

Who Vulturnus was, remains obscure. Perhaps it is the anagram of Turnbul, and
Trumbullius is an object of his censure in the Epigrammata. Lauder, in the Prefaee to
Musae Sacrae identifies him with the Bucaulus of No. XLV. In the Epigrammata, in
Vol 11.‚ will be found a poem “ De Horto Vulturni ’'. The notion of rapacity is latent in the
name. Benachie, Gadie, and Ury serve to localise the scene as in his native Garioch.

 

ARGUMENT.
Would that Ι had vigour in my veins, as once I possessed in my youth· ¹
ful years. I should not need to invoke weapons of the gods against Vul- l
turnus. The club of Hercules would be less strong than the Muses’ quill,
and the man who outrages a bard should not shout “ Victory ! '¹ Who knows
not the suicidal fate that Archilochus entailed on his father-in-law? or that of
the Ephesian painters, or the penalty of Ibis under Ovid's scourge? Small

offenders these, compared with Vulturnus, who, worse than a vulture, destroys 1

my means and substance. My modest home by the Gadie, under Benachie,
where the day at winter solstice is rounded by an hour, had adjoining to it a
small and not over fat field. It was rented to a farmer who paid a small rent,
and so yielded a maintenance to tendet children and to aged parents. Ι was
happy, and could despise eastern kings, busy with strains of song sometimes
in honour of Fergus and faffierland, or botanising for healing plants‚ as an
amusement for my age. Vulturnus saw and envied, and put his evil claws 1
into my good estate. My farmer he snatched away, leaving my fields to grow
thistles; and instead of following the Muses, I have to follow the plough,
to spread dung, and harrow, weed or dig with spade. The toils of seed—time
harass me, and the labours of harvest likewise. The flail wearies my right
hand, and the daily threshing of the corn shakes an old man's frame. Turs-
shielings thatched with rushes have to be reared each year. Horned herds 1
have to take to pasture, and again I am forced to tend sheep, leaning on a
staff. Ι have had to learn, alas, to shear sheep, after first washing them in
the healthful stream. My torments are like those in Orcus, and yet 1
