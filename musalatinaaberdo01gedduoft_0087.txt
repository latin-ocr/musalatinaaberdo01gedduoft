BOIIEMIAN STRUGGLF.. 50

VI. COMPLAINTS OF SARAVICTO AND BIOMEA.

This and the following poem concern the outbreak of the Thirty Y ears' War in 1619
and afford glimpses into the causes that led to that eruption as well as insight into contem-
porary opinion.

SARAvao To BIOMEA.¹

[AUSTRIA To BOHEMIA.]

ARGUMENT.

Open and read—'tis no hostile missive—-or does thy new spouse forbid ?
I, once thy Saravicto [Austrian], now ill-started, complain of ruptured nuptial
bonds. If offences are compared, Helen's offending was less than thine. She
yielded to the snare of an equal: thou rushest into perfidy; and, though
Helen's paramour was of equal rank with Menelaus, thou linkest to thyself a
menial officer of the Imperial Crown. My wooing was fair and candid, with
no compulsion, and no guile decoying thee like Dido into a cave in vain3

¹ To this poem and No. VII. Johnston alludes in No. XXXVIII.,in the retrospect of
his life: “ Tunc Saravictonias et quas Biomea querelas,'‘ etc.

This piece, with its counterpart No. VII., appeared independently with the title given
on p. 55, but with the addition of, “ Anno, MDCXX. ”.

[Α curious cut or device on edition of 1620 is described under the poem Nicrina, No. VIII.]

A clue to the interpretation of this poem was first obtained from the conjecture which
proves to be correct, that “ Biomea ‘’ is only a personification of Bohemia‚ pictured as at the
time of the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War in 1619, when the States of Bohemia‚ being then
three-fourths Protestant (Coxe, Αιιςίνίιι, 2·2o7)‚ tried to throw off the Austrian yoke, and
invited the Elector Palatine to be King of Bohemia‚ This conjecture was turned into
certainty by the discovery of an omitted couplet, which was present in the first drast of the
companion poem, No. VII., and which clearly brought into view the “ Utraquists '' or
Hussites of Bohemia. The antithesis, in that case, to Bohemia‚ can be only Austria‚ and
Saravicto turns out to be the Anagram for Austriaca or -0. The relation of these two warring
Powers (Coxe‘s History of Ameria, I. 372) is here figured under the image of a marriage that
hasbeen dissolved. Scotland was greatly moved in witnessing this struggle. J. H. Burton
(Scot Abroad. 11. 139) has an interesting account of a Scots contingent under Sir Andrew
Grey, which took part in the struggle in Bohemia‚ and had adventures recalling those of the
Greeks in the “Anabasis'’. Calderwood, who refers to Grey's expedition (7·444), has also

preserved (7·585-94) the long remonstrance of the Prince Palatine, add-ressed to his father-in-
law, King James.
