CONTEST 1⁸01< EARLDOM OF MAR. 203

XXXII. NICARES [ARESKIN] TO GARIOMARRA.

This and the following poem were long very obscure to the Editor, but the mist is now,
for the most part, removed. They belong to the period of the great suit of the Erskines in
Johnston’s time—-a suit that convulsed the North of Scotland—sor the Earldom of Mar and
for the reeovery of rights, to which, as a noble family, they laid claim. Under the word
Gariomarra it was felt there lurked the names of the twin upland districts of Aberdeen-
shire, viz.‚ Garioch and Mar, forming two out of the five ancient divisions. These
two were long feudally conjoined, the former as a lordship‚ the latter as an earldom.
(H. Laing's Seals, Ι. No. 322.) Both of these territories happen to be the districts
specially associated with the poet's birth, education, and early surroundings. For nearly
two centuries, in the period immediately preceding that of Arthur Johnston‚ the fortunes
of the Earldom of Mar, which, by old usage, was transmissible in the female line,
had been vague and unsettled—under perturbations, from which it has not yet, even in our
day, been exempt. In consequence of the failure of male succession in the early Celtic line,
on the death of Earl Gratny‘s grandson Thomas, ¹ about 1379, dislocations had arisen, break-
ing the continuity, and the Crown had more than once tried to step in and absorb the Earldom
as a royal heritage. In these perturbations, an attempt was made to set aside the line of the
Erskines, heirs of line, and claiming to represent the original House of Mar (see their Protes-
tatio, as early as 1391, Sp. Cl., Antiqs., IV. p. 163) ; and in the fifteenth century we find the
Erskines maintaining a struggle with the Crown, and endeavouring to add Kildrummy, the
stronghold of Mar, to their southern possessions, which lay in the neighbourhood of ΑΙΙοει.2

The following passage from Sir R. Douglas's Peerage, 11. 204, gives a notion of the
nodus at issue :—

“Robert, Lord Erskine, took a protest, in presence of the King and Council, in
Stirling Castle, 9th August, 1442, complaining against the Chancellor for refusing to retour
him to the Lordship of Garioch‚ and to put him in possession of the Castle of Kildrummie, pro-
testing that he should be free to intromit‚ at his own hand, with the whole lands of Mart and
Garioch3 and, accordingly, he immediately thereafter besieged and took the Castle of Kil-
drummie, whereupon the King seized the Castle ofAlloa '⁷. ’

¹Earl Thomas appears in Deed of David 11.‚ 1357 (collections, p. 539). Laing (Ι. 565)
describes his seal (Α.ι). 1368 and 1379), and styles him tlzz'rteenth Earl of Mar.

Stewart‚ Cochran, Erskine) in “Description of Aberdeenshire‚” collections (Sp. CL), p.
34; also pp. 82-3; and for Garioch, p. 88. For Talbot as claimant see Antiqs. (Sp. CL),

in Misc. of Sp. Cl., V. 273; see ibid„ 262—see also Dr. Davidson's History of the

Garzbch, pp. 56-9, 105-6, et plura. ’ An excellent account of the struggle is also given in
