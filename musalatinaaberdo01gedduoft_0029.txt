 

LIFE1 OF ARTHUR JOHNSTON, PHYSICIAN.
(1587-1641.)

ARTHUR JOHNSTON was descended of an ancient Scottish family
of knightly rank. The seat of his ancestors and his natal soil
was Caskieben‚ near Aberdeen, a circumstance which he has
indicated to us in the following very beautiful lines ῖ-2

Aemula Thessalicis en hic Ionstonia Tempe,
Hospes ἒ hyperboreo fusa sub axe vides.

Mille per ambages nitidis argenteus undis,
Hic trepidat laetos Urius inter agros.

Explicat hic seras ingens Bennachius umbras,
Nox ubi libratur lance diesque pari.

Gemmifer est amnis, radiat mons ipse lapillis,
Queis nihil Eous purius orbis habet.

Hic pandit Natura sinum, nativaque surgens
Purpura felicem sub pede ditat humum.
Aera per liquidum volucres, in flumine pisces,

Adspicis in pratis luxuriare pecus.
Hic seges est, hic poma rubent, onerantur aristis
Arva, suas aegre sustinet arbor opes.

Edition of Johnston's Psalms, 1741.

²This poem belongs to the series entitled “Epigrammata‚'’ and will
appear as No. LVII. of Vol. II.—It may be proper to state that the Caskieben
here referred to is the old Caskieben, at Keith-hall, as it is found so noted in
Gordon of Straloch's map of Aberdeenshire,
