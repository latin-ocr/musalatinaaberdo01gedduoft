XLIII. TO THE KING'S PHYSICIANS.

(A singular poem, chiding his seniors in office for living on so long. It is too seriously
touched to be entirely happy: laughter and banter would have made it more pleasing. See

James Bruce’s quaint criticism‚ Emincnt Men, p. 176; also in Row's Hist. of Church (Wodsow ’

edition, pp. 320-1)‚ an odd account os an illness of King James Ι. and its treatment by one os
the king’s doctors.)

ARGUMENT.

Princes of Apollo's art, why frown on rny ambition? Royalty, in two
generations, has yielded me a place in your society. Rich in titles, 1 looked
forward to pay, when one of you should be carried away by the Stygian
stream. I sit, waiting Pate, and Time, and Fortune on her wheel‚ but none
of these Powers eomplies. Yet Time conquers the rnost stubborn things; to
it both oaks and rocks must yield. Some even of the stars go out, but ye
show no sign of yielding. The threescore years and ten are overpassed by
you, and even the fourscore—the portion of the strong. ’Tis no result of
bulbs or roots medicinal grown beside the Thames‚ nor ofgrass from the Gram-
pian hills. Sorcery‚ I take it, is at ‘work, like Medea's or Circe's. Are ye
thus to elude Nature’s laws? Man’s life is but a tempest-toss'd sea. Ely-
siurn should be your aim with all its pleasures. Good men and brave have
sought it voluntarily: witness Cato and Cleombrotus. As Pollux underwent
hardship for his brother Castor's sake, so ought ye, on a brother's prayer.

Else, in jealousy of your life, Ι shall be forced to cut with my own hand
the threads of fate.
