30 PARERGA.

sprang 1 don’t like: 'tis unworthy of Jove. Try wind as a power impregnat-
ing. Ask the Tagus what are the exploits of Zephyrus in impregnation:
Vulcan himself is thought to be the product of subterranean wind.” Alecto
nodded assent : forthwith a donkey was pounced on, stripped of its hide, which
was stuffed to look its old self. Three openings were left to be filled with
wind. In rushed with a noise like Avernus the furies three, not without
infernal stench, and the stuffed figure was then consigned to earth. Ten
times Luna emptied and filled her horn, when lo! the ass-skin shot forth a
monster huge and horrid—a semi-human donkey, a semi—asinine man. Alecto
takes up the offspring, and bathes the creature in her native lake. With
sprinkling on its head, Acheron pronounced for Brontes as its name, Perse-
phone for Aeolides, Pluto for Onopordus. Washed from its filthiness, Ono·
pordus began to emit sounds, but whether of brute or human you could not
tell. Sometimes it seemed a brute beast speaking, sometimes a human being
braying. Thus hatched‚ the “ pupus '’ comes into the hands of the nursing
Fury, and so Tisiphone takes her turn and feeds him with aconite, mandrakes‚
Thesalian simples‚ and the juices of all noxious creatureS. With such un—
guents she anoints his frame, before it bore the gallows-mark‚ and she tipped
his tongue with venom like what killed Lycambes. The third night came,
and it was Megaera’s turn to rock the cradle. She addresses herself to sing
him asleep with songs, but the songs describe Phlegraean tumults hurtling
through chaos. Madness is infused, and the aliment supplied is the dog’s
meat of Cerberus, not without tobacco smoke. When he rejects the food,
Megaera bristles with all her snakes, and, all common-sense dissolved‚ she said
“ Farewell for ever ’'. How thereafter and by what auspices Onopordus came
to upper air out of his native dens, is a task for a Power Divine to explain;
let Mercury, who rules the dark confine between the worlds of light and dark-
ness, now rehearse. It so befel that Atropos had, pitifully toward mankind,
clipped her own nails and lost the power to nick the threads of life. Hence
for a time, no mortality and a pause of all funerals. Charon rocked idly in his
boat, screaming in vain for passengers. Pluto and his realm were in com-
motion, and a council of war was held. In full conclave the Father of the
Shades then spake: “Comrades, why this slumber? Avernus calls to the
rescue. 'Tis not a Hercules stealing Cerberus or carrying off Persephone we
have to dread. Religion itself is in danger. There will be no awe of the
gods, if Orcus gets closed. The way to open it is to send thee, Onopordus,
to the upper air. A plentiful crop of human folk will fall to thy sickle. Not
by war or martial tumult, but by craft; such craft as the spider or the fowler
or the hunter plies. The craft is that known as Medical—a wholesale slay-
