204 PARERGA.

On zoth June, 1448, an agreement was come to between Lord Erskine and the King
[James 11.] and Council, whereby, among other conditions, “the King and Council obliged
themselves that, so soon as the Castle of Kildrummie should be delivered up to those appointed
by the King‚ His Majesty should deliver up to Lord Erskine his Castle of ΑΙῙοει,1 and all the
warlike stores found therein ‘'.

After various vicissitudes‚ the restored Erskines obtained the Earldom of Mar in Queen
Mary‘s reign iu 1565, but it took a long time to establish all the rights involved in this restora-
tion. As Lord Crawsord (Earldom of Mar, 1. 379) states the matter :—

“ It was necessary for Earl John [os Mar] to proceed by legal process against those to
whose ancestors the Scottish Kings had alienated considerable portions of the earldom sub-
sequently to 1435 ; and the difficulties he had to contend w'ith may be estimated when I state
that the Lords Elphinstone, in the first instance, and next to them the [(ὶοι-ἀοηε]2 Earls of
Huntly . . . were all arrayed against him in the forensic warfare which lasted from 1593 to
1635, a period of above forty years ’'.

After the great victory of the Erskines in the lawsuit of 1624, whereby the Elphin-
stones were dispossessed of Kildrummy Castle‚ a further advance was made against the
minor vassals to recover rights of superiority similarly alienated. Lord Crawford‚ in his
Earldom ⁰f Mar (1. 447), states that by process of Law, following the decreet of 1624-6, 150

or more proprietors were called into Court‚ and presumably among these Johnston of
Caskieben was included..

In these two poems, XXXII. and XXXIII„ the Lordship of Garioch and Mar seems to
be figuratively treated as a “ lady fair,'' wooed by suitors, of whom Nicares³ (i.e.‚ Erskine, in
its older form Areskt‘n) is the foremost. The pair of poems, Nos. VI. and V11., are in
similar vein.

ARGUMENT.

Nicares [Erskine] sends you this from Alloa. Read it through. O
Lady Gariomarra! you must submit to your husband. Your action toward
me was not a betrayal, such as Helen‘s‚ who was cozened by a flattering
stranger. Force was applied, undisguised‚ like that used to Dejanira‚ to
Ischomache, to the Sabine dames, to Hermione. 'Twas Hymen that made
you mine, and our marriage torches shone beneath the Northern stars in
hope of unbroken wedlock. But Ι was cruelly deceived, and you were reft
away. Against similar wrong Peirithous rose in arms, and eke Orestes too.

¹ It was from this passage of Sir R. Douglas that the interpretation of Aloicis, in the
opening line of XXXII.‚ was obtained, which gave the key to the whole poem.

² See Earl os Huntly's Protestation (Antiqs.‚ IV. p. 245) as early as 1587. How directly
the Gordons were concerned, see the Deed between Lord Elphinstone of Kildrummy and
Gordon of Cairnborrow (Antiqs. (Sp. CL), Vol. 11. 184); also ibid„ p. 40: a suit against
Duguid os Auchenhive by Mar (As). 1634): likewise, in 1587 (Antiqs.‚ IV. (Sp. Cl.) 244), John,
Earl of Mar, and Wishart of Pitarrow, are at law as to ‘¹ Strathdee‚'' etc.

³ It is remarkable that the house of Erskine, which is not native to the North of Scot—

land, should have eventually possessed itself of two of the great Aberdeenshire Farldoms,
viz.‚ Mar and Buchan.
