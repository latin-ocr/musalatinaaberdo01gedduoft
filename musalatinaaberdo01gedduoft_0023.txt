LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS.

FRONTISPIECE. PORTRAIT OF ARTHUR JoHNsT0N‚ Mssnrcus REGms, after
Jamesone, the original being in Senatus Room of King’s College.
The following extract from Bulloch's Jamesone refers to the
original :—
This “ fine head‚'' according to Granger, is on a panel‚ and inscribed, “Anno 1623.
AEtatis 36. Nosce te ipsum.'' The picture is as it left the painter’s hand⁷ and bears
evidence of his most careful manner. The result is a refined and thoughtful countenance,

originally done with much delicacy of treatment and now still farther mellowed by time.
The poet has an expansive forehead.

“ Long visaged, strong chinned, high of nose,
Large eyed, with gaze stern, sweet, sublime,
Well bearded, grand of chest and arm,
Browed as if brain to heaven would climb.''

An ample piped linen collar covers his shoulders.

The original is in Hall of Marischal College. . . .

A fine portrait of a handsome subject, and, notwithstanding the manifest touch of
another hand, is substantially what Jamesone left it. Under a bald dome there is a set
of fine, regular features, and the whole expression and dress bespeak the gentleman. A
rich lace collar, reaching from the ears to a point half way down the breast‚ forms a
suitable baekground to the flowing, pointed beard. His arms are painted in the upper
right-hand corner, with “ S. P. M.l of Kinmundy, Vive vt Vivas. Anno 1620 AEtatis 67.’'

Sir Paul was a prominent member of a family which for many generations had taken
a leading part in Aberdeen affairs. From the beginning of the fifteenth century the
