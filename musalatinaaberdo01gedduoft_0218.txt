whom we learn that among his final words he repeated in Hebrew the closing
words of the 5th Psalm.

The date of this poem (which seems linked, as to time, with its com-
panion elegy‚ No. XXVIII.) is 1628; the brother mourned was William of
Craigievar, who died on December 27, 1627, and the two elegies appeared
together in 4to from the press of Raban in 1628.

ARGUMENT.

A truce to tears, O prelate, indulge no ignoble grief. There is no weep-
ing for the sailor when his bark rides safe in port with flying colours, nor for ·
the soldier singing songs of triumph in the capitol. He whom you mourn has
moored his bark safe from all billows: he exults in victory. The visions and
enjoyments of heaven are his, and he looks down from his lofty seat, and
smiles upon our little scene. Ours is the sad lot to fight with storms—-how
many! and to be tossed in whirlpools—alas‚ how manifold and turbulent! Ῐ
You will count more readily the ears of yellow grain, or the snow-flakes
shed from the cold winter sky: more readily will you reckon up the twigs ¹
of heather on the moors of Corse, now sharing in your sorrow. Countless
are the ways of death; coughs, and gout, and the whole cohort of diseases‚

including that not lightest of ailments—being old. Fortune too is fickle, ,

and, whether she smiles or frowns‚ is treacherous. Poverty is bad, but
wealth may be reft away, and a man’s family may bring him shame. One’s
property may perish in the law courts: we then fall back upon our repute
and fame; but the tooth of envy is gnawing at the root even of that fair
tree. This was once your lot, but your piety proved to you a shield.
Besides private ills, public supervene. Spain threatens, the emperor joins

the foe, and France has broken alliance. From all such ills your brother is i

set free: therefore rejoice and be glad.
