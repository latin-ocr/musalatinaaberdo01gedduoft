EPIGRAMS ΟΝ DEATH OF JAMES I. 95

Χ. EPIGRAM,

(Appeared first in 1625 in volume referred to on p. 86 above. Not in
Edition 1632.)

Jove and the Sun have favoured countries and Kings. Yet both powers

have now combined to grudge thee longer to the world, and so, O prime,
the order of Nature, by thy demise‚ deeays.

ANoTHER OF THE SAME.

(Not in Edition 1632. A variation of this Epigram occurred in 1625
volume.)

March marched off with the King: no wonder: Mars, that month's
stormy god, loves not Pence-makers.
