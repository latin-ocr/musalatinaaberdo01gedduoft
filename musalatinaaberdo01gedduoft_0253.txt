CONTEST FOR EARLDOM OF MAR. 211

XXXIII. GARIOMARRA TO NICARES [ARESKINJ.

ARGUMENT.

The letters which a spouse of royal lineage might have spurned from a
pretended husband, Gariomarra has perused. ’Tis all fictitious—the match,
the abduction, the complaint‚ Far be it from one, who is a queen among
northern maids, to wed with a servitor, yea, slave. I have a husband, once
your lord, wielding the ancestral sceptre with thundering hand: Gratny it was
that joined me in this wedlock. W'ould that the Northern Bear could speak,
to which you appeal as a witness ; this quarrel would have an end, and your
nets and snares be exposed. In those snares a crowd of your retainers was
inveigled, but they begged for mercy at the sovereign’s feet. You claimed
nothing save the honour and titles, but you hoped to creep into the chambers
of my Lord and to get, with his lady, the dowry too. Ponthelis [Elphiston]
resisted, and sought to shield the royal [chartered] rights, but his raft in his
life's voyage proved unfortunate. It is natural to complain of injury done to
Prince and sceptre. Even dumb Atys had his tongue loosed‚ when he saw
his father in danger from the drawn sword. By this example Dolagus
[Douglas] is encouraged, and Sthinoon [Johnston] , smitten with the same am-
bition, presumes to be my consort. The quarrel has passed into the Courts

Α of Law, where Nogrodus [Gordon] shields the royal rights, and challenges

you, Nicares [Areskin], to fisticuffs, fearing not the weapons‚ whereby Pon-
thelis [Elphiston] succumbed. The Council is arbiter of our fate; my hope
lies there; for who could deem that the Lords of Council could betray their
prince? It was of old the Caledonian's glory to die for fatherland and the
king, the land's sire. Forbid that we should think our land had conspired
against its sovereign lord. Sooner would I believe that Don had begun to
run backward toward the Western sea, or that Ury had climbed the crags
of Benachie. ’Tis in vain to pour forth tears and groans mixed with prayers
and threats. The sacred band of heroes looks down with a frown on such
arts, and a sharp-eyed Judge, but blind to all else, is there, before whom
the millionaire and beggar are alike. To such good care Ι confide my fate.
