DEDICATION. 5

A portrait of Scotstarvet at Balcolmie is referred to by Pinkerton in his
advertisement of the “ Iconographia Scotica ''. A signature of his appears in
a deed in the Skene volume (New Spalding Club, p. 224), where mention is made
of Sir William Alexander, George Hayof Kinnoul, and others, figuring likewise
in ArthurJohnston’s poemS. A letter from him in Scots to Gordon of Straloch,
dated from Campheir in Holland in 1645, appears in Miscellany of spaldings
Club (Ι. 52). Plura regarding him in Sir R. Douglas’s Baronage, Miscellany
of Spalding Club, Ι. p. 37, Preface; Gordon’s Scots Affairs, Ι. 32 and 24,
Preface; also Professor Masson’s William Drummond.

ARGUMENT.
To THE NossLE PATRoN OF THE MUSES,

JOHN SCOT OF SCOTSTARVET,

D1Rsscr0R oF THE ΟΗΑΝΕΕΚΥ, MEMBER or THE K1NG’s COUNCIL 1N
SCOTLAND.

At length appear under your auspices and at your charges, Most
Honoured Sir, the Scottish Poets. ¹Your Patriotism shows itself in two forms :
you preside over the Archives recording our Estates and their Titles: you give
perpetuity also to the memorials of native Genius committed to the Press.
For want of such care and patronage the poetry of many men of Genius has
perished. The works of Ennius and Archilochus and many more have been
lost through want of such care. The Sibylline leaves of your countrymen you
rescue from moths or the fingers of grocers. You follow the example of noble
patrous, such as Archelaus toward Euripides, or Scipio toward Ennius. The
‘⁵ Horae subsecivae ” of men of parts should be rescued from oblivion. High
is the merit and great the lustre of such rescuing and protecting patronage.
This uttermost corner of the earth, called Scotland‚ lying as it does at the very
edge [hinge] of the world, has received lustre from Buchanan, doubtless the
foremost Poet of his time. That sun vanished‚ but you redecorate the sky
with new and brilliant stars, yourself among the number.

In the selection from such a host of Poets as came trooping, you have
exercised discretiori. The only ground of censure is possibly your inclusion
of the name J0hnston among these stars, perhaps through some fond daz-
zling of your eye testing too kindly upon me. It may be, however, that my
demerits may act as a soil, and so give lustre to the rest, as the dark shadows
of the painter bring out by eontrast the brilliant tints of a picture. Regard-
less of sneers, hold on in your great career, giving immortality to the Scottish
Muses. The prayer of your devoted Admirer,

ARTHUR JOHNSTON.
