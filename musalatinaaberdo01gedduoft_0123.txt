CRY OF THE PALATINATE. 85

of the Queen of Bohemia, and that they needed none from the Popish
stock of Henrietta Maria. “Words,’' says Mary A. E. Green (V. 483), “ of
ominous meaning—the faint and early expression of that strong national
feeling which afterwards hurled the elder branch of the Stuarts from the
throne of Great Britain.”

Perspicacious and witty‚ she could express character by an epithet‚ and
her own son, Prince Rupert, whose impetuous disposition she early discerned,
was styled by her as a name jocose, “ Robert le Diable'’ (Green, V. 539).
Charming and elever letters may be referred to as samples of her wit ¹ (Green,
V. 462; VI. 51; her signature, ibid„ V. 483). She died in London on the
morning of the ἐξ of February, 1661, “at the age of 65 yearS‚ 40 of which
had been spent in the sorrows of exile, 30 in the still bitterer woes of widow-
hood,’' and she is buried in Henry VII.⁷s chapel at Westminster. The Latin
epitaph over her is given in Th. Dingley (Camd. Soc.)‚ II. p. cccclxxv.; but
there is no worthy monument, either literary or artistic, to her memory.
Besides Green's Lives of the Princesses and Nichols' Progressa& consult also
the volumes of the Camden Society, Relations of England and Germany
(where are letters in French of her husband Frederick, and a description of
the court of Heidelberg in her time by the ambassador, Viscount Doncaster,
afterwards Earl of Carlisle); Wills from Doctor’s Commons (where we find
the will of Princess Elizabeth).

¹ The princess was not only braver than her husband, but far superior to him in mental
qualities. Her brother, Charles I.‚ indicated this when, in referring to his ‘⁶ sister and brother,'‘
he adds, “I place thern so, because I think the grey mare is the better horse '‘ (Green's Lives,
V. 448). Donne and Ben Jonson vie in poetical tributes to this princess : the latter styles her,
with almost prophetie insight, that “most princely maid whose form might call Ι the world to

- war and make it hazard all Ι Its valour for her beauty. She shall be Ι Mother of nations‚'' etc.

 

Verses of Elizabeth's own on the death of her eldest brother, Prince Henry (Green, V. 193).
But the glory of all tributes is that of Sir Henry Wotton in her praise (Percy's Reliqucs):
‘You meaner beauties,'' etc. Regarding the Prince Palatine‚ see the admirable lines of
Thomas Heywood in 1613 (Perc. Soc. Fut„ 111. 3·17) at the period of his marriage with
Princess Elizabeth. Plura as to the Princess above on p. 77 n.
