EPISTLE ΟΝ 11Ιὸ OWN POEMS TO SCOTSTARVET. 199

XXXI. To THE SAME, DEPRECATING THE SENDING '1¹0
PRESS OF JOHNSTON’S POEMs.

This poem, like ΧΧΧ., occurs in the Edition os '32.

ARGUMENT.

Scot‚ what cause for this? Why rush an old friend's name before the
ι public eye ? Plague on the inventor who first transferred the press to subserve
a new function, the sacred service of the Muse. Machines of that order suit
brawny labourers to squeeze the ruddy grapes in the wine press, or the ripe
olive berries in thy olive press, O Pallas. The gifts of Phoebus are not for
such torturing machines. Retirement suits the modest Muse, who likes to
preserve her virgin purity. As Penelope shunned the crowd of suitors, and
as Jove's altar disdained foul hands, so the bards shun contact with the crowd.
The blear—eyed mob look askance and misinterpret, as does the jaundiced
eye. More afraid am I of the censure of the wise‚ and the insufficient labour
of the file. Obscurity is sometimes a boon, and my poems shun the glare of
ὶ day. Ennius sang the struggles of young Rome, but Itis poems have perished
with their author, and Linus and Orpheus, though names of fame, left no re-
l mains. Let me partake the lot of these chiefs of song and conceal my (warts)
¹ poor performances. In early spring no one gathers grapes or sweet apples.
l 'Tis when grown yellow that the grain is to be reaped: spare the green blade
ἱ of corn. Better‚ with your leave, to retain these productions till the tenth year
is passed. My name should not appear in such a galaxy; the slender reed
is poorly heard amid the trumpets' clang: the screech owl should be silent
when the swans are singing. Purple and hodden grey do· not harmonise3
the nettle and the rose make a bad combination. Affection for the bard should
not dazzle your eyeS‚ as Orestes and Patroclus were blind each to the faults
of his bosom friend. If, however, you insist, Ι submit. The painter makes
use of shade to throw colour into relies, and so my poems may prove a soil to
show off the brilliancy of others, much as, in contrast with Thersites, Ulysses
looked more fair. Ι arn resigned to my fate, if I march to it under your lead
and guidance.
