stealing‚ but the drinking of the wine. What? is the vinedresser not to
have a sip of his own purveying‚ or the bee of its own nectar, or the ass a
munch of the vegetables in its own panniers? Perhaps they wanted
humanely to protect from temptation the virtue of their countrymen, like
Themistocles, who drank bulls' blood to keep himselffrom harming his country-
men. Perhaps they fell short of water on the mid sea—water, water every-
where, and not a drop to drink. You would not surely inflict on them the pains
of Tantalus. But suppose no thirst. Could a mortal refrain from the juice of
Bacchus? No more than Cato, Alexander the Great‚ or Ennius and Homer.
No son of Caledonia more thirsty than the old Salts. The story goes that
[Tyrrhene] sailors loved Bacchus, when a boy, at sight. If all this does not
mollify your mind, O Menzies! think of the arts of your city. These arts
are but tricks of trade, and merchants and thieves are both under Mercury's
protection. Even Phoebus has his thieves: Ovid purloined from virgil,
Virgil from Homer. Yea Rome itself at first was a nest of raiders. Caesar
made booty of all. Among six sailors there were consumed only two casks
of wine. The rest of the cargo may sell all the better z Let the price rise in
consequence in the town, and tell the burgesses to drink more sparingly and
temperately. So good will come out of evil, and public benefit from this
petty lareeny.
