CONTEST FOR EARLDOM OF MAR. 205

Hermione’s mother, the fair Helen, was the cause of a dire war, ex-
tinguished only in Troy's smouldering ashes. But, though I am wronged,
the desire of revenge is vain. Who can contend with his King? Alas!
the adulterer who has wronged me bears such high chartered titles.
Achilles was deeply moved because of the abduction of Briseis, but even
he refrained his hands from injur-ing the King of men. My weapons,
therefore, are not warlike; they are tears and groans and supplications,
better weapons than Vulcanian thunderbolts. Fortune has been a
hard stepmother; but, though the wrong is a continued wrong, it is not
justified thereby. Nor, though the tooth of time consumes all else, does
time's sway affect the claims oflegal rights. Penelope remained her-husband’s
spouse even in her lonely desertion. Perhaps the royal connection is the
attraction. But Achilles retained Briseis’ affection even after she was reft
away. She wept and said: “ Achilles, come and assert my rights, from a
sceptre's gilded baubles Setting me at large '’. Violence to nuptial rights
brings mischief. Dishonour carne from the amour of Venus and Mars, and
of Poppia in Nero’s embrace. My rights over thee are good, flowing down
from Tygrana [Gratny] himself. The goddess justice and Anna Perenna
have sealed and recorded this. The envy of “ Fifteen '’ men of high degree
has carped at rny nuptial rights, but the censure has passed away like dry
leaves in the East wind, and King and Council have recalled the censure, and
sanctioned my claim. Nogrodus [Gordon]‚ 'tis true, asserts the new edict has
no force, but he puts black for white, and confounds all rights. Crime has
been shielded‚ and the bark of Nogrodus [Gordon] is almost safe in port.
Yet I am not much moved : Tantalus was likewise teased, when thirsty, with
the sight of waters ; when hungry, with the sight of apples near. I have seen
generals, when about to raise the shout of victory, fall back in flight, or a

¹ beast of the chase rescued after being touched by the fangs of a Molossian

hound. So even in its haven the bark of Nogrodus will be wrecked; and
as for Ponthelis [Elphiston] , whose pinnace once rode proudly, he paid the
penalty of his own folly. In these waters, along with Doulagus [Douglas]‚
Sthinoon [Johnston] will sink: Then I’ll enjoy you, O Gariomarra, with
heaven’s favouring help, at length from all rivals free.
