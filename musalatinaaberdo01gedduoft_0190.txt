148 PARERGA.

Then notice the cruives facing them in their march to the upper waters.
These cruives get filled and peopled like the Trojan horse, or Danae’s tower,
or the Labyrinth. On the Saturday the cruives must be withdrawn, to allow
the salmon to sweep on to the upper waters. The skull ofa horse and its
white bones are sometimes deposited to fright them and make them run into
the crate or basket awaiting them. A great variety of pleasures thus belongs
to this craft. 1f I am not at church‚ my people are. But hearken, the
people’s weal is compromised through these darts at me. If you lay an
embargo on nets and fishing, you leave us without wine, which comes into our
cellars as wares bartered in exchange. I'll keep diligently all the Six Com-
mandments of my Duty to Man, but Ι wish to draw my nets twice on the
festal day. The day which you hold sacred is to me a day of activity, for it
was on the first day God laid the foundations of the world and created Light ;
whereas, if you count the times, it was on the (Saturday) Seventh day that
He rested from creative work. The First Day is the Sun’s day, and lie never
gives his steeds repose, and so we servants of Phoebus lash the waves; with
this slight distinction, that He manages the world’s affairs, I manage only
mine. The example of the Clergy of old is on my side ; they exacted tithes
for fish, while they let the oxen on the Sunday go free: and so the yoke
of old was not thrown around the neck of fishermen. Rest to leis bones, who
devised that boon. Squeeze out the salmon fishing, and whence will you
purchase wine to strengthen the young and to enliven the old ? Who could
partake of the smoky drinks that Scotia yields ? The barley-J'uice is a mixture
1 do not affect3 let horses champ the barley ; pour out the Falernian for me,
my boy. If on this sacred day all labour is interdicted, why, Mystic‚ is your
kitchen-fire then ablaze, and why do you let your servant-maid cook the fat
pullets ? To be consistent, there should be no water taken from the well, nor a
bleating sheep extracted from the ditch. The sails would thus flap idly at sea,
and so the coal-miner would b‚e left to be drowned in the mine by the rising
subterranean waters. The salt-works, the glass-furnaces, and the iton—furnaces
would be stamped or damped out. In winter-time we can have plenty of
days of rest : so let me keep the day in my own way. The children of Israel
kept it with weeping by Babel's stream : I will keep it duly also, and make
both banks echo my prayers. Lastly‚ may the Nymphs give me a tomb
beside it, with this inscription: “ Here rests the owner of the neighbouring
pool, while he drew vital air, not master at the same time of that which was
his own. Indifferent was he as to the future, and believed that Heaven above
and Hades beneath were, in one respect, both alike. There are Pisces [i.e.,
Fishes] in the Heaven and there are Rivcrs in Orcus; so either place promises
opportunity for the sportive crast.'’
