EPISTLE TO SCOTSTA RVET. 195

XXX. TO MR. JOHN SCOT OF SCOTSTARVET, KNIGHT‚ oF
THE KING’S PRIVY Commu, ON THE OCCASION OF Hls COM-
MITTING To THE PREss THE POEMs OF THE SCOTTISH AUTHORS.

[This superscription contains the addition of ‘¹ Equitem‚'’ which was not in the title pre-
fixed to the Dedication as given under No. Ι. The effect is, to our modern ideas, somewhat
incongruous, if we translate ‘⁶ Dominus'' by ‘⁵ Mr. ”. Probably “ Dominus '’ is simply terri-
torial‚ marking him out as a ‘⁴ Laird,’' with which his rank as “ Eques ’³ did not interfere]

On this important person, and friend of Johnston‚ see No. Ι. above. The occasion of
this poem, which occurs as early as ⁷32, was, no doubt, the preparation making for the
Delitiae of ⁷37.

ARGUMENT.

Go on and bravely finish the work of printing the poets of Caledonia.
As the sun imparts light for nought and makes other orbs ray forth, so wilt
thou bring out stars now obscured. The rescue of a citizen was of old re-
warded by a crown of ilex: many such garlands will be earned by you for

- names of rescued bards. Immortal honour has been his who saved from de-

struction the work of the bard of Andes. Your patriotism is meritorious in
preserving so many luminaries of the northern sky. Not that I mean to com-
pare the Grampian poets with the Latin muse. There are varieties of gradation
among the Latin poets themselves, but, though not equal to Virgil, as Virgil
yields the palm to Homer, they yet live and are immortal as the orchestra of
song. A place in that orchestra is claimed for our country's bards. The stars
shine with various light; the flowers show varied radiance‚ each having its own
beauty. The ancients have their lofty qualities : the moderns reflect the same
as in a mirror, and the reflected image has its own grace as well. Be rigorous
as to expelling faults and blemishes from too sels-indulgent bards, and the
praise will fall to you the same as falls supremely to the honey-bee which
fills its golden cells from the honey-yielding buds and bells.
