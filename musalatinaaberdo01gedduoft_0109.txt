 

BOHEMIAN STRUGGLE. 75

Nec me, quae recitas, terrent incommoda belli,
His quae sustinui sunt leviora malis.
Imminet, exclamas, sacris cervicibus hostis
Barbarus, et praedam forsan utrumque feret.
Has utinam pietas movisset vera querelas,
Et non fucatus relligionis amor. 310
Sed vereor, notas ne tu delapsus ad artes
Pelle sub hoedina tigrida saevus alas.
Exue te larvis3 si tangunt candida pectus
Numina, cur mihi me, cur aliena rapis?
Me mihi linque modo, timor hic vanescet in auras:
Barbarus hic neutri tum metuendus erit.
Ast ego cui certo? cantatur naenia surdo:
Non tibi relligio, sed Biomea placet.
Hanc petis, hanc ardes, hanc nolles linquere praedam,
Si vel tota Deum cum Iove turba roget. 320
Caesa cadam potius Biomeae victima, tristis
Umbra prius Stygios, inquis, adibo lacus.
Haec si fixa tuae constat sententia menti,
Quod facis, hoc cito fac, vela secunda precor.

324. Quod facis, hoc cito fac.] Addressed to Judas in St. John xiii. 27. Biomea thus
desires the fulfilment of the sels-imprecations with which Saravicto had in VI. closed his appeal.

’Ἥ The fires still slumber, of which the two preceding poems, Nos. VI. and VII.‚ mark
the old eruption. It is interesting to know that recently (as may be seen from the following
extract from the St. James’s Gazette) a party in Bohemia renews the old complaint z·—

“Considerable excitement was caused in the Austrian Reichsrath by a speech of Dr.
Gregr, the leader of the Young Czeehs, in which he inveighed against the manner in which
Bohemia was treated by the Government. ‘The majority of the Czeeh population of
Bohemia‚' he continued, ‘ is utterly wretched in the midst of this alien empne, and the longing
to emerge from their Babylonian captivity has already penetrated into the lowest strata of the
Bohemian people. Could the Bohemians of long ago have foreseen what would become of
their descendants, their ehoice of a King in 1526 would have been very different. Their
nationality Is oppressed and persecuted in this Austrian State, which is a State of violence
and tyranny towards all Slavonie taces. The bond between the Crown and Bohemia will be
severed if the traditional rights of Bohemia are scouted much longer, and the future relations
of the two countries will be those of the conquered towards the conquerors.' ''

N.B.—The year 1526 in Bohemian history marks the death of Ludwig ohne Haut, at
Mohacz, and the accession of Ferdinand 1.‚ of Spanish-Austrian line.
