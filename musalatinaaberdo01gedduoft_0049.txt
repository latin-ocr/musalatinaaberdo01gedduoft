burgh as a native (Life of ΒιιεΙιαηαιι, p. 114), and Johnston seems to imply
the same in the poem No. V. (line 3²2)· Besides J0hnston‚ there rose a host
of assailants to Eglishem: John Leech (Leochaeus) had also a poem ‘⁶ Ono-
pordus’'; Daniel Heinsius in Holland (Irving's Lffe of Buchanan, p. 114);
and William Barclay, M.D., wrote his prose “judicium'' against him
(London, 162o; reprinted in Lauder's Poetarum Scotorum Musae Sacrae,
Edinburgh, 1739).

Eglishem is credited with an extraordinary production called “ Prodro-
mus,'‘ in 1626, on which see Nichols' Progr„ IV. 1033; John Rous's Βίαν)ν
(eamd. Soc.)‚ p. 124 n. A curious pamphlet appeared in London in 1642,
purporting to be by “ George Eglishem, Doctour of Physick, and one of the
physifians, to King James of happy memory, for his Majestie’s person above
ten years' spaee'’. It accuses the dead villiers, Duke of Buckingham, of
poisoning both Hamilton and the king. This led to a caricature (in 1642) of
the ghosts of King james, Hamilton, and Eglishem confronting Buckingham
in Hades3 each of them in winding-sheets and capped (even Buckingham)
by a Seotch thistle. (See Vol. F2 3·80 in Aberdeen University Library.)

ARGUMENT.

The charges of the miserable doctor against Buchanan have been
examined: a case of madness, is the verdict of the whole Faculty of Medicine.
’Tis not the fine frenzy of the poet: but such madness as drives an Orestes
to fury, the result of a mind distempered or brain diseased. The hallucina-
tion is one that breeds monstrous fancies—as when a herdsman deems
himself a king, takes his crook for a sceptre and turnips for royal dainties:
another fellow believes himself a spider and catches flies, or a grain of
corn and shudders at a bird; another thinks he is made of glass or earthen-
ware; yea, and we have seen fellows who thought themselves already
dead and in Pluto's halls, and would not greet their families or eat their
food. Such is Hypermorus’ madness, he deems himselfa poet and strums
on the Aonian lyre: anything but musically; fancying himself a Maro
or Maeonides. Yea, and he presumes to spit down the stars. ’Tis thou,
Buchanan, whom he assails, thou, to whom the world looks up in awe.
Those psalms of thine‚ the lays of the son of Jesse in a Latin dress, he
would consign to the flames or obliterate, substituting a version of his
own. The madness mounts into a crime, a crime against Apollo, who
