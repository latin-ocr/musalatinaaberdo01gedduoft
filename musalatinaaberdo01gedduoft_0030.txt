XX LIFE OF ARTHUR JOHNSTON, PHVSICIAN.

Propter aquas arx est, ipsi contermina caelo,
Auctoris menti non tamen aequa sui.
Imperat haec arvis et vectigalibus undis,
Et famula stadiis distat ab urbe tribus.
Haec mihi terra parens ς gens has Ionstonia lymphas,
Arvaque per centurn missa tuetur avos.
Clara Maroneis evasit Mantua cunis ;
Me mea natalis nobilitabit humus.

The following spirited translation gives the import of the

above lines :— ¹

Here, traveller! a vale behold,

As fair as Tempe's, famed of old,
Beneath the northern sky;

Here Ury, with her silver waves,

Her banks in smiling verdure laves,
And winding wimples by.

Here, towering high, Bennachie spreads ²
Around on all his evening shades,
When twilight grey comes on ς
With sparkling gems the river glows;
As precious stones the mountain shows,
As in the East are known.

Here Nature spreads a bosom sweet‚
And native dyes beneath the feet
Bedeek the joyous ground3
Sport in the liquid air the birds,
And sishes in the stream, the herds
In meadows wanton round.

Here ample barn-yards still are stored
With relies of last autumn’s hoard,
And firstlings of the year;

² From the Appendix (p. 13) to Genealogz‘cal Account os tlte Family of
Jolmston. Edinburgh, 1832.

‘2 This line departs from the vernacular pronunciation of the mountain.
We are inclined to read : “ Here Benaclnie towers high and spreads ”.
