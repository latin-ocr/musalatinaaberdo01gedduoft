 

DEFENCE OF A FAT I‘AUNCH. 207

LII. AGAINST ONE WHO JIBED AT A FAT PAUNCH.

This jocular poem is a fine specimen of Johnston's lighter quill. The occasion,
whether personal to himself or to a friend, is unknown.

ARGUMENT-

You snarling scarecrow, Zoilus, why this attack on one’s fair rotundity?
Why point me out with the finger? If we praise the quadrupeds for being
sleek and fat, why not rnen as well ? ’Tis a mistake to think fatness and glut-
tony go together. Alcides [Hercules] is not styled fat, nor yet Homer ; and yet
the one ate heavily, the other liked his wine. Overfed frames grow lean, just
as the willow is a thin tree though it drinks for ever, while the oak grows fat
and strong on driest ridges. WVhere there is good lining to the bones, there is
also a pleasing disposition3 witness the ox or lamb; for, if you seed well the
boar, he drops the thunder of his tusks. 'Tis lean scarecrow creatures that
are given to deeeit or rapine, as witness the dog, the lynx, tiger, hawks‚ and
eagle. The fat man has a cheerful face, with no carking cares, and loves
peace; the lean man is sourfaced, given to cunning, and loves battles and
broils. As for activity‚ I grant, fat folks are not so agile. But agility of body
is no sign of power: the judge sits sedate; the steersman sits at the helm; the
general gazes quietly around and surveys the battle. So with the spirit
dwelling in us fat men ; itself unmoved, it moveth all. We can use, for fleet-
ness, the keel or the wheel: but to purchase simplicity at the eost of one‘s
obesity is a price too dear. No sear of the mind growing fat and feeble.
Think of Galba and Nero: what contrasts they in mind and body! A fat
[Pope] Leo outshone in genius the sons of Athens. And, look you, there is
the goddess of wisdom. Does she not love the fatness of the olive? Feats
of strength Ι leave to others of the strong. The stadium and racc-course call
for them; my haunts are the Forum, seats of learning, churches. Even in
Venus’s service the fat man is not behind. Who can find apples on a dry
stock? Away, then, Zoilus, with your sneers and scowls.
