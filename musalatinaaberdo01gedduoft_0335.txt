of Frendraug'nt. On the fatal night these two Gordons, after due entertainment, retired with
four followers to rest, and awoke only to find the castle blazing underneath and around them
with no egress possible. These guests all perished in the flames, and the suddenness of the
calamity‚ coupled with the known causes of hostility, raised the dire suspicion that the fire
was not accidental but the result of a plot nefariously prepared. Judicial investigations
were set to work, but sailed to bring home guilt to any party ;' and though one John Meldrum
was executed as concerned in the deed, he seems to have been as much a victim as a guilty
party. The poem of Johnst0n‚ written while the tragedy was fresh in remembrance, is full of
lurid suspicion, and the Lady of Frendraught is darkly adumbrated under the name of Lupa,
although, as the note on the passage will be found to indicate, the evidence is not complete,
and the whole affair remains a mystery.

Whatever was the real state of the case, it is not to be doubted that a blight seemed
thereafter to fall upon the House of Crichton, and, in the notions of the popular mind, it
seemed to labour under a mysterious doom. Like the ancient royal houses of Argos or of
Thebes, both the rival families felt the scourge of a haunting Nemesis, for the fite at Fren-
draught‚ which eonsumed one os his sons, was thought a retribution to the Marquis of Huntly
for his share in the burning of Donibristle and the slaying os the ‘⁴ Bonnie Earl of Moray‚'‘ the
famous Regent’s son. The feud continued long, and Montrose, in 1639, sought in vain to
make peace, for he desired the then marquis “to take Frendracht by the hand'' (Spalding,
Trubles, Ι. 169). The burning of Frendraught is believed to have fallen on the night between
the 8th and 9th of October. 1630, about two o'clock in the morning (Sir R. Gordon, Earldom
⁰f Suthcrland. p. 412). The chief victim, whose widow is here supposed to utter the lament be-
wailing him, was John (second son of the first and great Marquis of Huntly), who had married
Sophia Hay, a daughter of Francis, ninth Earl of Erroll, and had been created in 1627 Vis-
count Melgum, a title which he took from an estate of that name in Aberlemno, near Brechin,
which estate then formed a part of the Gordon domains. His elder brother, George, after-
wards second marquis, had then the title os Earl of Enzie, served long in the gens d'armcs of
the French king, and is the Huntly who was executed in Edinburgh for his adhesion to King
Charles Ι.

The widowed Lady Melgum is, therefore, the Sophia Hay of Johnston's lament‚ and
the Sophia Hay of the popular ballacl “ The Fire of Frendraught‚'' where her distraction is thus
pourtrayed :—

¹⁴ Sophia Hay, Sophia Hay,
O bonnie Sophia was her name ;
Her waiting-maids put on her clothes,
But, I wot, she tore them off again ”.

Spalding has in prose a sympathetic tribute of kindred pathos. She died on March 14, 1642,
leaving one daughter. A glimpse of her in her widowhood in R. Chambers’ D. A„ 11. 128.
See also in Vol. 11., No. LIX., an epigram of Johnston in her praise.
