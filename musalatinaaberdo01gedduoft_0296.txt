2 54 PARERGA.

Arbitrio stabunt nostra cadentque tuo.
Dumque palimpsestum teris infelicis amici,

Ture litans votis tu tua iunge meis.
Non peto vel messes Arabum, vel farris acervos,

Arva vel ut findant pinguia mille boves. 80
Orbis ab extremi septis et Gadibus ipsis,

Vomere seposito, posse redire, sat est.

*J Among the more important works of Robert Baton, the following deserve special
notice :—

1. Philosophia Theologiac Ancillam (Philosophy as Handmaid to Theology). Published
at St. Andrews, 1621 ; reprinted at Oxford, 1641.

2. Disputatio Thcologica deformali objecto Fidei. Raban, Aberdeen‚ 1627, 4to; reissued‚
Aberdeen, 1633.

Baron is Professor in Academia Mariscallana, and holds this disputatio to obtain the
Doctorate in Theology “in Academia Regia, Praeside D. Ioanne Forbesio ⁷'. It is dedicated
to Paul Menzies os Kinmundy, Provost; the Town Counci13 and to ‘⁸ Petrus Coplanus ”. In
the Presace it is stated that the purpose of the disputant is ‘¹ ad Pontificiorum errores convel-
lendos''. Prefixed are three Epigrams in honour of Baron's Doctorate. In the first occurs
the neat compliment—

‘⁴ Baroni cerebrum Scripturae est capsula sacrae ''.

In the second he is likened to Scotus and Aquinas in intellectual parts, but with a
difference—
“ Conveniunt multis: tamen est discrimen in uno:
Romani simulant, quam tenet ille, fidem ’'.

The third bears the name of Williarn Johnston‚ Arthur's brother, who became Professor
of Mathematics at Marischal Collcge in 1626, and was thus a colleague of Baton-—

‘⁴ Laus tua, Baroni, nostra non indiget arte,
Cum medici tantum postulet aeger opem.
Morbida censetur, quae nullo est parta labore ;
Quae venit ex merito, laus bene semper habet ''.

3. Metaphysica Generalis. Leyden, 16543 London, 1658.

This posthumous work contains a Preface in praise of Baton, who is styled “ Baronius
Noster ’'. The authors cited by Baron include not only Fathers, Schoolmen and Reformers,
but Rabbins, as well as Avicenna and Averroes. ’
