 

oN VULTURNUs. 281

know not what crime I have committed to cause such suffering. If I had
a fault, it was favour for Vulturnus, whom Ι once praised to the defilement
of my Muse. But, Apollo, pardon me. Evil things have received poetic
honour: Virgil glorified the gnat, and Homer the frog, and there have
been eulogies on baldness and quartan severs, on such things as nettles
and turnips. So Ι once praised rural life, which I hate now worse than
I hate dog or asp. Better for me to have cultivated not the Muse but Mars:
I should then have taken vengeance on my enemy, whereas now he owes
his life to my age and weakness. Of old the warrior cherished and protected
the bard, and the medical craft has not less claim than poesy to favour. But
why waste words on such a boor, whose ear is better pleased with the ass‘s
bray or the creaking of the wheel of a water-mill ? Ι imprecare on the head
of Vulturnus all the ills that fell on Ibis—an offender not so bad as you.
Thereafter be this the distich on his tomb: “Here let him rot, a man who
preferred a rough-booted ploughman to the Muses, and a mill to Apollo‘s

lyre ’'.
