To CAELIA. 255

XLII. TO CAEL1A‚

Who “ Caelia'’ was, and what is the precise import of the poem, is obscure. The exact
key to the interpretation is not discovered, and the interest is mainly in the classic colouring
given to the northern localities. Caelia seems, from its usage elsewhere, a name for any
beauty or “celestial body'’. See similar odes “Ad Caeliam¹¹ in Delitiac Poct. Scot., II.
77, 114. In Martial‚ 7·29 and 1176, it appears only as the name of a courtesan.

ARGUMENT.

In traversing Garioch and its snowy tracts‚ beware of the waters of the
Gadie; taste them not, touch them not, look to them not, but shade your
eyes with both your palms. Gadie is known to all the world, yea‚ to the
under-world as well. Not that it turns to stone or does other harmful things.
It infects with amorous desire: such as appeared in the dames of fable old.
There is some virus in its waters. The stream is believed to spring from
Tyrian Gades, and, like Alpheus, finds its way northward underneath the
sea. Avoid its waterS. A chaste Penelope will, under its influence, depart
a Thais, and Diana herself will follow Dione.
