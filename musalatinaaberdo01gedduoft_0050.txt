16 PARBRGA.

touched with his own bearn Buchanan's page : a crime against King David,
shorn of his melodious lyre. The injury to the Caledonian bard touches
Caledonia and Caledonia‘s king, who owes his learning and taste to the
poet now defamed. His proud name makes little Scotia great, and Maro
and Maeonides are, in theme, to him inferior. Wars of men and intrigues of
Gods are ignoble compared with the inspirations from the Hebrew lyre. Thus
great as a poet, Buchanan is also great as an historian, recording deeds ancl
captains as great as those of Greece or Latium. And but for a slip in one
particular, who, O king, deserved better at thy hand ? He formed thy taste, as
preceptor made thee an accomplished monarch and taught thee the difference
between a tyrant and a king. Strange therefore must be the madness of this
barking Anubis. What can be its origin? Has a Fury or a Gorgon flashed
upon his path, or Cerberus, or a mad dog or ettercop bitten him? or some
virus of Echidna or hippomanes, or insomnia, or too much drink, or crazy
love, or has he eaten insane herbs, or been driven distraught by frostbite or
by sunstroke? Perhaps some Dutch case of hydrophobia among his crowd
of Dutch patients has infected him. Grim following he has of barking and
howling patients. Hence, perhaps, the contagion like leprosy, like scab
among sheep, like venereal disease. But, O woe, what is the cure? Is there
any herb or drug to palliate? Apollo would grudge to such a wretch his heal-
ing art. The crime is one of lese-majesty to Phoebus; so felt in dire ex-
perience Agamemnon, king of men, who learned that the Deity has long arms.
Yet the poor patient may hope for alleviation‚ as the drowning castaway will
struggle amid the waves. The fury may be restrained. So, quick‚ then, pro-
duce your remedy. Perhaps a strait jacket‚ binding him like a beast with a
hundred chains, like Pentheus or Ajax or other maniacs of old. Then solitary
confinement in a dungeon dark may be helpful, not without scourges and
whips to ‘⁴ mend the morals, never mind the pain ” ; then from the house of
correction take him and plunge him into cold water, to cool the fury. Apply
the knife as well, and the lancet to let out the venom. Especially to the head
attend; for there is the seat of the malady, and open the veins to give vent
to the “leprous distilment'' gathered within. Or let the leeches suck him,
and give him bowls of aloes. Nay, as extremes meet and one heat must be
expelled by another, try him with fire, cauterise the fellow. These “ems'’
by the faculty are good, but sometimes there are remedies better: herbs and
simples of a potent kind; among these one that flowers when all plants fade,
and laughs at winter snows. ’Tis Hellebore [Christmas-Rose]. 'Twas the
discovery of Melampus, who cured the mad daughters of Proetus. Gather all
you can of it, though fifty carts be needed, and treat him without, within, by
