SATIRE ΟΝ EGLISHEM. 17

chewing, by fume-inhaling, all the methods. You may mix perhaps there-
with poppy or mandragora, to cool his brain. But if the pharmacopoeia of
his native land suffices not, you must cart him off to some brighter clime,
Anticyra, where there is plenty of Hellebore, where Drusus and Carneades
got healed. Would that he had been purged at an early stage by such juices,
before he ventured on his unholy task. Three Anticyras, I fear, will not now
suffice. But do not despond: there remain prayers and religious rites. In
the depths of the forest of Ardennes there is a shrine with wooden figure: ’tis
Saint Hubert, a saint of power. When Jupiter once groaned beneath his
load of cares, he lightened the burden by distributing various functions.
These found recipients: two alone remained undelegated. One was that of
keeping widows frorn second wedlock; the other that of expelling rabies. By
comes Hubert on a little ass: and the option was put to him. “ I choose the
latter function: 'tis much the easier.'’ So the fame of Hubert grew, and his
shrine was sought by mad folks. There by lustrations in water under the
priest, by figuring in a white sheet and sundry kissings of the ground, not
without dorsal applications and herbs and fasting, the madman comes round
to sanity. Though the way is long, Hypermorus must try it: heaven alone
ean help the head of him.
