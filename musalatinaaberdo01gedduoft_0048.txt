IV. THE COUNCIL OF THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS ¹ Ι

OF PARIS ΟΝ THE MANIA OF THE QUACK DOCTOR.

This is a long burlesque in which J0hnston satirises by the name of
‘⁴ Hypermorus '¹ ¹ a physician of the name of George Eglishem‚ who had been
foolish enough to rail at the Latin Muse of Buchanan and even to offer a
rival and superior version of the 104th Psalni. This satire is a juvenile
production‚² and is probably the earliest of Johnston's longer pieces. The
cleverness of it, as of the companion poem, No. V.‚ consists in the dexterous
manipulation of the whole wealth of medical vituperation which he launches
on the devoted head of his victim. To us at this distance it looks a useless
expenditure of fury, “the club of Hercules to brain a 'gnat’'; but we must
remember that Eglishem was a “Medicus Regius,'' and that Buchanan's
name, though high in poetry, was, from his treatment of Queen Mary and
his views as to the prerogative, low in court favour politically‚ and so needed
a defendet. That Johnston overdid the castigation is probable from the irony
of circumstances, which led Johnston afterwards to assume the r6le of
a rival to Buchanan——a position which he was largely led into by the
court patronage of Laud, who wanted to see a rival star in the firmament to
eclipse the “ Northern Sidus '' of George Buchanan. In his early days, how-
ever, when breathing the atmosphere of the continent and Sedan‚ Johnston
felt as a Scotsman for the glory of Scotland's then greatest name, and did
not foresee the time when he himself should be a “ Medicus Regius '’ and a
courtier,

Eglishem, according to Dempster (Hist. Ech.‚ Ι. 271), was a native of
Hamilton (Eaglesham is a parish close by); but Irving assigns him to Edin-

¹ I-IypermoruS‚ i.c.‚ ὑπέρμωρος;“ supreme sool ”. This nom dc gssucrre appears in all the
editions except the Parisian of 1619.

²1t appeared as a separate poem at Paris, in 1619. with a much fuller title, in which
Eglishem is named; sor aster “mania‚'' in the Latin title (see page 18) is inserted, “ G.
Eglishemii, quam prodidit Scripto, cui titulus Duellum Poeticum,'' etc. 1n the lines os the
Latin text, likewise, ¹⁴ Eglishemius ’' appears undisguised‚ instead of the later ⁴⁸ Hypermorus‘'.
