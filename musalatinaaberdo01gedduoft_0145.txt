take their place. Yet here he is foiled‚ and, though twice beaten, prepares a
third resistance. Cruelty of delay is seen in the petitions of patients who come

who weep for my return. 1f these pleas move not, restore me to my Lord and
Master‚ who is King of Britain, and to whom Ι owe medical service, apart
from all these forensic trammels. The King entreats and invokes a Western
Goddess in my favour. But why prolong complaint? justice is safe in your
hands, for it is your own safety in the end. Yield not to my adversary, who
has been judge in his own cause. Ι decline no impartial judge, however rude
and barbarian, but let not a Cacus drag Johnston to his den.
