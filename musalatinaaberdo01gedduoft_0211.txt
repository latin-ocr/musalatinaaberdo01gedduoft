XXVI. To DOCTOR “PONTICUS‚'’ TO URGE ΗΙΜ ΤΟ
MARRY.

A remarkable melange of humour and learning. Who the exact subject of it was, does
not appear. Besides Ovid‚ Propertius, who is the elegiae precursor of Johnston, has poems
“ad Ponticum Poetam ”. “ Pontice castor,'’ Ovid, Nux„ 166. The castor, or beaver, carne
from “ Pontus‚” in Asia, yielding a medicinal preparation much used. Traces of a Doctor
Pont, who seems to have been a quack, at Aberdeen about 1643 (Spalding, Trubles, II. 292) ;
also in Scotland in 1633 ; R. Chambers, D. A„ ΙΙ. 295.

ARGUMENT.

Glory of Machaon’s race, now grey-haired, yield to the claims of love.
Prolonging life here and there by drugs, you yet, by your inaction‚ suffer the
race as a whole to perish. No miracles of generation occur now through
such means as Deucalion’s stones, or ant-swarms producing Myrmidons, and
the rest of such fabled sources of mankind. The power of Venus, think,
how high it is among gods as well as men, even over Apollo, the master of
the healing craft, and, next to Jove, the most amorous of all the upper Powers.
Besides Apollo, there is Aesculapius himself, who though healer of the sick,
became sick with love. To descend to men: Aristotle was a married man,
culling kisses and bestowing incense3 Socrates also enjoyed the lawful wife of
his bosom; Aristippus loved Lais. Think of the power that love infuses into
warriors, into an Achilles from the kisses of Briseis, or a Hector from Andro-
mache's embrace. Even cold Boreas and Tithonus warmed with love, and
likewise Cato the venerable. If strength is less than in youth, the pleasure
is as high. A wife may bring dowry as well as bring children. The hire-
ling does not look after one's property like a son. You owe a duty to your
country and to your country's maidens, who may otherwise become either
beggars or beldames, warlike Amazonian dames. Help your country with
young citizens, though Hesperus is already appearing in your horizon. Be a
sire when by rights you ought to be a grandsire now.
