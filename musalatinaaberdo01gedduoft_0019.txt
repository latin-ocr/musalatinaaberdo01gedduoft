 

PREFATORY NOTE. ix

it is almost hopeless for us to expect to recover the thread, in
every case, of pertinent and precise allusion. Some light might
yet be thrown upon these obscure poems, if one could recover
the papers of James Man of Aberdeen (1753), the defender of
Buchanan in last century, who is known to have made “ collec-
tions'' with a view to an edition of Arthur johnston (Book of
Bon-Accord, p. 214; Stark's Bz'ogr. Scotica). His papers are
said to have passed into the hands of Professor Thomas Gordon
of King’s College, and to have been in the possession of the
latter in 1794. If any antiquary knows of the deposit‚ it would
be a favour to communicate with the Editor. Living as James
Man still did in a time when tradition could not have entirely
faded away, it is possible that he may have embodied in his
papers information which would still be of value and contribute
to the interpretation, not only of portions of the present volume,
but still more of the varied “ Epigrammata '’ which have yet to
be dealt with, in the Second Volume of the Series.

In issuing an appeal for information leading to the discovery
or exhumation of these missing papers of James Man, it may be
convenient to make mention of another Lacuna which some
collector may supply, and that is the poem of Thomas Cargill,
about 1593, in honour of the foundation of Marischal College.1

² Among the Burgh Accounts, 1 592- 3, we find the following (Asina, Sp. CL,
V. p. 117) :--

‘⁴ Item, to Mr. Thomas CargilL to caus print certane verse in Latin, in com-
mendatione of my Lord Mercheall for erecking the new College in Aberden, at
the Counsallis command, 3 Lib.”.

In 1626-7 are the following entries as to similar “ poesies '² (Mica, p. 202) :—

“ Item, to Mr. Alex. Forbes, for ane poesie presentit to the Prowest in praise
of the toune, 13 Lib., 6s. 8d.

“Item‚ to Mr. Wm. Cargill, for sum poesie dedicat be him to the Counsall‚
10 Lib.”
