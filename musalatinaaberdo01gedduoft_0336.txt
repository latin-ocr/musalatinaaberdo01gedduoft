294 PARERGA.

ARGUMENT.

Is there then no guilty cause on earth or in Hades, beyond and beside the
fated flames? no author of the crime, whom retribution can pursue? 'Tis
known what guilty one fired Troy towers or Delphi's shrine, who burned
Clyciades and Creusa. We know also Phaethon's conflagration‚ how it arose.
In darkness lurks the name of him who blighted my heart’s love, the scoundrel
that dared to roast in flames the flower of young Caledonian chivalry. And
yet ’tis certain there is a guilty one who was the cause; it was no outbursting
visitation of the gods, for Scotland knows nothing of volcanic flame. Acci-
dent, too, is excluded; or if any one thinks it is blind Fortune‚ such a one is
more blind than she. The tower was of stone—cold stone—oak-floored, and
the cellars arched, presenting no fuel for the flre. And yet thence the flames
issued‚ those flames which rose to affright the starS. Night had come, and
my spouse was closing his eyes in slumber, those eyes that were never to l
behold the rosy-fingered morn. Combustion broke out with all sulphureous
elements‚ and there followed the crash and roar of burning bearns and stones
dissolved. Groans and shrieks arose, but, in a moment, all was consumed.
The rest God only knows, or Night‚ or the guilty Tower with its surviving
stones. One dread certainty alone remains : my husband and his companions
perished. The friendly evening supper proved a funeral repast, the bed-
chamber a tomb3 live brimstone fed the funeral pyre. The charred remains
were laid out in the emble—a den inhuman as that of the Thracian savage.
They were stretched on tables, at which, the evening before, they had sat as
guests, and were presented, like as dishes at a feast, next day. But where is the
guilty party? Besides the hangman's noose, the ‘⁶ boot'' was plied, but plied
in vain to find the mystery. Ah! why did the guests alone suffer? Why did
the father and his sons flee when morning broke? Why did the she-wolf i
show reluctance to have her domestics interrogated and put to the question?
'Whoe’er it was who mixed the brimstone and applied the toreh, the miscreant
was within. The guilty criminals are known to the Ruler of the skies, and
He will avenge. Ye lords [of Session]‚ so oft appealed to in vain, from you 1
turn to the Supernal Powers.
