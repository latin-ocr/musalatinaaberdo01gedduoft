 

ELEGY ON JAMES 1. 87

War, p. 66 (Eng. Transl.).) King James forgot the difference between an hereditary and an
elective monarchy. It sounds absurdly delicious to know that the pupil of Buchanan thought
to pacify the despairing appeals of his son-in-law by those soothing lines of Virgil (Aeneid,
12·21-3): “ O praestans animi iuvenis,‘’ eamd. Soc. volume on Relations between England
and Germany (p. 35). In his enumeration of Scottish Worthies up to his time, Sir Thos.
Urquhart of Cromarty closes thus with the name of King James:—

“ His Majesty is placed last, as in a Parliamentary procession, and bringeth up the
rear, as General Ruthven leads on the van3 for, as Ruthven was such a meet souldier that
he could neither read nor write; so King James was such a meet scholar, that he could
neither fight by sea nor land. He thought James the peaceabZe a more royal stile then William
the Conqueror, and would not have changed his motto of Beati Pacifici for the title of Sylla
Felix‚” etc. (The Jewel, p. 138.)

The world has laughed at James Ι. shrinking from the sight of a drawn sword. The
peculiarity was, in his own age, attributed by Sir Kenelm Digby to the pre-natal influence
exercised upon him by his mother's fright at the murder of Rizzio. Some colour is given to
this explanation by the statement of the matter as found in the ‘⁴ History of James the Sext ’'.
Motley, in his United Netherlands, 111. 139, describes “ King James as that hard-featured,
rickety‚ fidgety, shambling, learned, most preposterous Scotchman ” ; and similarly Professor
Masson (Drmnmond, p. 146) z “ The big-headed, thick-tongued‚ shambling,'' etc.

We cannot omit the epigrammatic observation that “James reigned like a woman, in
succession to a woman who had reigned like a man '’.1

Among the curiosa of his history is the singular Impresa in Holyrood tapestry of his
mother, Queen Mary (referred to by Wm. Drummond in his Letter to Ben Jonson), symbolis-
ing herself and her only son—-“ A Big Lyon [Lioness] with a young whelp beside her, the
words, Unum quidem sed Leonem ''. Bitter is the irony of the French rejoinder :—

“ Tandis (μ’ Elisabethfut Roi,
L’Angloisfut d'Espagne l’effroi‚·
Maintenant, devise ct caquette,
Regi par Ia Reine Jaqnette”.

Thus rendered by Henry Green in his Emblem Writers, p. 122 :—

“ While Elisabeth, as King, did reign,
England the terror was of Spain3
Now, chitter-chatter and emblemes
Rule, through our queen, the little James ’'.

ARGUMENT.

So thou liest low. Piety and a people's prayers are all in vain. One
might arraign in such a case Heaven's high decree. Tears are no longer
natural in any one not born of a hard-hearted rock or a Hyrcan tiger. Upon

1This is an echo caught from Cecil's (Lord Salisbury) confidence to Harington
regarding Elizabeth, “who was more than a man, and, in troth‚ some times less than a
woman ”. (Nichols’ Progr„ Ι. 146.)
