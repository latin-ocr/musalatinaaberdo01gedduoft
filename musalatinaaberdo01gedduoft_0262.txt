220 PARERGA .

the singer of the Iliad was not cut short till Lethe's shore was reached,
and so with Mar0; the Pindaric old man died with lyre in hand, and
the voice of Orpheus was lost only in the gurgles of devouring Hebrus.
May no withering or eclipse befall the Muse of Menstrie‚ that men should
say, What a change is here, in one who penned things worthy of Sidney,
and who touched gracefully both the classic and the sacred lyres! No
more for thee the rura] haunts or youthful employments. The city's
hum, the din of Court‚ the fatigue of a thousand fretful duties‚ all
assail thee ; and sleep is encroached on by public care and by anxiety for the
people’s weal. To increase thy cares, over and above the trouble thou takest
as to “Old Scotland‚” the founding of a new colony, a “ New Scotland “
[Nova Scotia]‚ distracts thy thoughts. There, in a new world, among quiver-
armed Indians, cities and temples rise at thy bidding, and laws and civilisation
are founded. Thy life is like Leander’s‚ that strong swirnmer in the surge,
or like that of Sisyphus or Ixion on his wheel. Perhaps Ι may be rash in con-
demning city life in the instance of a poet. Virgil, Naso, Horace, Martial,
all composed when in the city, and Buchanan‚ the Siren of Caledonia, sang
amid hubbub and the arms of brave men. Yet lte allied Helicon to Mount
Zion, and struck with Roman plectrum the Hebrew lyre. To these bards make
thyself the co-mate and associate, giving a part of thy time to a wider world

than even thy country and its court compose.
