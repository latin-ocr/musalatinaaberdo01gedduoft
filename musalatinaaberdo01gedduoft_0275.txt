TO CHANCELLOR HAY AGAINST MISCREANTS. 233

XXXVIII. TO THE CHANCELLOR [HAY‚ OF KINNOUL]
ON THE MADNESSES OF THE THUNDER-AND-
GUNPOWDER MISCREANTS.

(Some enemy is denounced under the title “ Brontotyphus ''. The key to the occasion
of this effusion has not been discovered. It occurs in ed. 1632.)

ARGUMENT.

Is Justice, O Hay! to be a mockery‚ with thee alive? Is the poor
to be oppressed, and the quiet votary of the Nine to gird on the sword he
dreads? There, look at your humble servant, poor Johnston; he is cased
in iron, bristling with arms. The links of his armour are as numerous as
the scales on any fish or on the Libyan viper. From out his vizor his
face and eyes alone are seen. ’Twas no enchantress that transformed
me. That was all the misereant's doing (Brontotyphus). A small
farm 1 have which yields oats alone, and feeds fleecy sheep. Here
was my haven of life’s repose, and my hope was to Spin quiet lays in praise
of my country and its heroes, and, chief among these, the Hay, who is the
founder of thy line. Ι was fortunate, moreover, in the King’s favour: a
portion of the Court‚ though humble, Ι could claim to be. But Brontotyphus
destroys the fair vision, despoils my cottage, and robs me of my cattle. He
is armed with all weapons‚ and employs also the fite-vomiting tubes. Girt

τ in thick hides and steel, he stalks the land, fierce as Orestes or any other
, maniae of the stage. Against him, Oh do bring me relies, my friend Hay. A

Poet should not be a warrior. Beneath another sun I have spent four-and-

. twenty years, singing the praises of my Phyllis, and the complainings of

Saravicto and Biomea‚ and the story of the crafty son of Aeolus [Eglishem of

“ IV. and V.]. In seeking healing herbs in the lonely groveS‚ 1 felt no fear.
2 Restore to me my still repose, and confound the robber of my farm, the spoiler
ζ’ of my peace. A thousand arts he has, to fawn and wheedle and deceive:

which arts do thou foil, and shield the Muses’ son.
