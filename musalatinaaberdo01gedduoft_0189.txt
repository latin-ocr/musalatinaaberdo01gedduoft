A FISHER’S APOLoov. 147

XXIII. A FISHER’S APOLOGY.
(Not in Edition of 1632.)

In this poem we discern the delight which, in common with Martial and all
anglers, Johnston felt in drawing out his fish upon the bank, “ Piscem tremula salientem
ducere seta‚'' or with Ausonius in watching the leaping of the salmon, as he shows
his speckled sides, “puniceo rutilantem viscere ’³ (Mosella, 97). In line 120 sea-fishing is
glanced at, but the main stress is as to rivenfishing, the scene being, probably, at New
Leslie, in the parish of Leslie, where Dr. Arthur Johnston is known to have possessed
an estate (Collections, Sp. CL, p. 546), in which case the stream is his favourite Gadie.
It is in form and occasion a defence of Fishing on Sunday, against the Puritans. The
Sabbatarian question was largely prominent in those times, and stringency increased as
the Covenant came to be in the ascendant. See R. Baillie's Letters (Ι. p. 173), where
we find, in 1638, at Glasgow Assembly: “ Dr. Guild commended for his paynes in helping
much to put down the Sondayes fishing in the North ’'; also Spalding, Truhlcs, II. p. 25 ;
Gordon's Scots Affairs (Sp. CL), II. p. 162, where Editor, in note, quotes ancient “ Papal
allowance'’ for fishing on Sundays. So, as early as 1608, Bishop Peter Blackburn protests

. against Sunday fishing (Book of Bon-Accord, p. 250).

ARGUMENT.

Why make war on my nets, you Mystic ? Why am 1 forbidden to fish
on Sunday? To the Jews (Apellas) the law is binding, not to us who are
the sons ofJaphet. The law of God is just and liberal to all. The Seventh
day (Saturday) is a festal day, and thereon the Divine being healed the man of
the withered hand, and his companions abstained not from ears of corn. On
the Sacred (First) day, it is wrong to harrow or to work oxen in the yoke: no
loss in their waiting for the morrow. But in fishing, how swiftly the
occasion flies! A salmon disports in my pools ‘to-day: to-morrow he fixes
his haunt in the upper stream. Why should Ι let another devour the
creatures 1 have fed ? 'Tis not a work, but a pastime. The huntsman and
fowler make a toil of their work ; mine is a refreshment. Oh the delights of
net-fishing‚ ending with the casting forth of the gasping captives on the
‘sands‚ and there is the killing and the gutting, and the stripping and the
salting: also of rod-fishing with bait and many-coloured fly concealing hook
of bronze. What a charm in the hooking and the racing and the chasing oi
a fish when hooked, until, tired with a thousand meanders, he is landed on
the shore high and dry! Sometimes with sling I lash the waves, or with
dart (Scotch leister) I pin the sleek swarms beneath the wave. Sometimes Ι
entiee them into osier hand-nets‚ now Ι fish by night with the blazing torch.
