304 PARERGA.

LI. TO GORDON OF CRAIG IN AUCHINDOIR.

A graceful and friendly appeal to his friend to come forth from solitude and reveal hi
powers. James Man refers to the subject and gives an abstract of the poem (Scots Affairs,
Spald. Club, Pres. I. p. 48). The Den of Craig, which Johnston exhorts him to abandon, is still
celebrated for its romantic beauty. See Collections (Spald. Club), p. 614, and Sir R. Gordon,
Earldom, p. 514. A singular supplication, about ΑΛ). 1630, from “John Gordon, elder, of
Craig‚‘' detailing pecuniary difficulties, is found in Spald. Club Antiquities, IV. p. 459. Re-
ferences also to Gordon of Craig in R. Chambers, D. A„ I. 541-2 3 ΙΙ. 38, 59.

ARGUMENT.

Why, O Gordon, hide away from town, a prisoner among Cabrach
heather, among rocks and dens? What signify thy parts, thy learning, thy
travel, if they are all to rust and fust unused? No civilised creature near
you; nothing but foxes’ holes, the fowls of heaven, and deaf, cold rocks.
Under hoar-frost always, and even under the Dogstar-—it is a country clad in
snow. Seek then another home for the Muses and for thee. Tully preferred
Rome to his native Arpinum, and so ran the proud example of Naso, virgil,
ancl Catullus, whom, pray, follow. 'Tis hard, I trow, to quit the paternal
fields, but one’s country gives the call. Think of Menoeceus, Decii, Scae-
vola, Fabii, Erechtheus who sacrificed a child, and Brutus who gave up a
son. Thy country calls for thy gifts, and Themis summons thee to her aid.
Achilles went into hiding for a while, and the hand that was destined to wield
the mighty spear, handled for a time soft wool. Him Ulysses rescued and
restored to Greece. A parallel gift in thee let Scotia owe to me.
