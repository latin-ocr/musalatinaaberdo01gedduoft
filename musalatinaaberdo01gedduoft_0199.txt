APOLOGY FoR A FORESTALLER. 157

XXIV. APOLOGY FOR BALDUS DARDANARIUS.
(Not in Edition of ⁹32.)

A mock-heroic defence for a forestaller in the Corn and Provision Market. No clue has
been got to find the real name of the person so defended. ‘¹ Bauldy ’¹ is a Scotch colloquial
praenomen for Archibald, and occurs in the Gentlc Shepherd. [In the Prefatio, p. 7, to the
Parasynagma Perthense (Calderwood) of 1620 occurs a jibe against “Ioannes Abrenethaeus

Episcopus Cathanesiae ‘⁵ as making gain “ex lotio et malis aliorum humoribus ut medicus,
aut clauso ct compresso frumento ut Dardanarius ”.]

where is the harm? He follows the example of Thales and imitates Joseph
in Egypt, who saved not his country only, but his brethren and his helpless
sire. He grumbles in fine weather‚ but in a damp, wet time his spirits rise.
Small trace of gold or silver in his dealings: only copper is current in our
northern elime. Yet he scrapes and semipes, and is useful in picking up
wealth of town and country. Away goes the countryman from his bit of land,
