12 PARERGA.

III. DEDICATION OF THE “PARERGA’' TO SCOT OF
SCOTSTARVET.

Nowhere does the Muse osJohnston move with more graceful ease than in these finely-
touched lines of this Dedication. It recalls somewhat of the flow and cadence of the great
Dedication os Buchanan to Queen Mary, which is the Dedication par excellence, the model for
many later imitations.

ARGUMENT.

Greetings to Scotstarvet, who is the pride and ornament of the Scottish
Senate‚ one worthy to have been a consul in old Rome; greetings to him as
a jurisconsult‚ from whom even Pallas would not disdain to learn the artS,
Themis the laws, yea, virtue the canons of virtue. Greetings to him also as
a poet approved by Phoebus and a Maecenas to other bards. Greetings to
him as rescuing my lays from extinction‚ who am therefore his loyal liegeman.
This volume, as a small pledge of a great affection, Johnston offers : being a
mingling of mirth and earnest‚ it may prove a recreation to smooth by a
smile the brow of care. The only reward sought is that the lays may please
Scotstarvet.

Line 1. Scote.] The fourfold repetition has an effect like the duplication of “ Scots “ in
Burns‘ Ode.

Line 9. Magni leve pignus.] Recalls the feeling of ὀλίγον τε φίλον τε (Iliad, 1. 167).

Virtus nos ornat.] Johnston's own anagram of his Latin name, ‘⁴ Arturus Ionstonus ”.
His friend, Samuel Naeranus, at Sedan, complimented him with an epigram expanding this
anagram :—

⁸⁶ Non fasces, non eloquium, non mentis acumen,
Non census, non nos stirpis honestat honos:
Verum nobilitat mortales unica virtus:
Haec Christi in sponsa dos placet una tibi ”.
s (Nacrani Poemata, p. 68.)
