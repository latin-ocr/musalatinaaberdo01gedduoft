XLVI. EUDEMIA’S GHOST TO EUDEMIUS.

No key has been found to this poem, thch is a protest against some displacement to a
plebeian grave, and no link of connection with any known fact. In Lundie's poems. p. 10,
nearly contemporary, we find a lover's sweetheart finally touched off with—

“ She is not Loda, nor Laodomia,
She is the Muse's fairest Udemia ”.

The strain of the sentiment towards the close reminds of the contemporary Scotch
ballad known as the “ Laird of Drum '’ (Child's Ballads, IV. p. 118) of which the final stanza,
in the mouth of the plebeian spouse, as given in the Percy Soc. version, thus runs :—

“ Gin ye were dead, an' Ι were dead,
And baith in grave had lien, O,
Ere seven years were at an end
They⁷d nae ken your dust frae mine, O ''.

ashes been at rest when a crowd under armed leaders gathered round and tore

ὲ up my urn with truculent iron hand, singing insultingly over my remains.

 

'Twas a night of darkness; the sun would be no witness of such deeds, any
more than of old he tolerated Thyestean feasts. Cynthia too was ashamed and
refused her light, and the doer of such a deed deserves that no starlight ever
shine upon his path. I shrink from counting him a Seot or of old descent3
'he must be a son of grim Caucasus or Rhodope, for no barbarians have so
cruel hearts. They maim the living, but leave alone the dead. Among such
merciful barbarians would that I had laid my bones and got my testing-place.
The perpetrator claims to have right as owner and lord, as was the case with
tombs in Jewish times. Other nations respect sites of interment as public,
not private, domain. Ovid is allowed to rest on the Euxine strand, and
Italians gave a funeral pyre to the Samian sage. In Egypt Pompey's ashes
