4 ARTHUR JoflNsTON.

Ι. DEDICATION OF “DELITIAE” TO SCOT OF
SCOTSTARVET.

The Latin Dedication to John Scot of Scotstarvet, which is prefixed to the
two volumes of the “Delitiae,'’ is from the pen of Arthur Johnston. Besides being a
piece os gracesul composition, it is interesting as a solitary specimen of Latin Prose, so far
as now appears extant, coming to us from Johnston's hand. In the poems XXX. and XXXI.
will be found a large instalment of the same ideas in verse, as are here expressed in prose.

Scot of Scotstarvet was a Fifeshire gentleman, who had his seat near
Cupar in Fife, and enjoyed high legal office in the time of Charles Ι. After
Scotus Erigena in the far distant time and Michael Scot of magic fame in the
medieval time, there is no one of the name of Scot so famous as was Scot-
starvet‚ until the rise of Sir WVaster, who of course eclipses the united lustre
of all former owners of the name. Scotstarvet, as a jurist, rose to preside
over the Chancery of Scotland) and lived to the age of eighty-four, having died
in 1670. A shrewd man of the world, he was a central figure among the scholars
of the “ Delitiae‚'' which he superintended as well as projected, and he seems
to have been a sarcastic and even cynical critic in his latter years, if we may
judge by that product of his pen “The Staggering State of Scots Statesmen ’⁷
——which Mark Napier (Montrose‚ p. 524) calls that “ malicious manuscript'’
—giving very unflattering views of his contemporaries (R. Chambers, D.A.,
11. 479). Sir James Balfour speaks of him severely as ‘⁶ a busy man in foul
weather ’' (Memoirs, ΙΙ. 147), but records his generous foundation of the Latin
Chair at St. Andrews (Ib.‚ ΙΙΙ. 185). Scotstarvet is further interesting to us :
as the brother-in-law of William Drummond of Hawthornden‚ whose sister,
Anne, he married; as himself one of the poets of the “ Delitiae,'' owning about
twelve pages thereos in verse, chiefly elegiae in metre, and as the bosom
friend of Arthur Johnston, through whose influence, doubtless, he was enrolled
an honorary Burgess of Aberdeen on August 31, 1622 (ΒιινξῘιΙ Records, Spald-
ing Club, p. 377). The eulogies of the Muse are frequent to him in the
“1)elitiae‚'' and besides Nos. 111. and XXX. underneath from Johnston, we
find incense offered by William Barclay, Henry Dansken, and John Rose
among the pages of the ‘⁴ Delitiae,“ as also by Isaac Gruter (see poem
prefixed to ‘⁴ Delitiae ”), by Caspar Barlaeus, and by John Leech (Leochaeus).
