XI. NEw-YEAR GREETING TO THE KING [JAMES 132.

IST JANUARY‚ 1623.

The work of presenting Strenae or New-Year gifts to King James, and receiving
presents in return, was a serious business. See Nichols' Progr„ Ι. 593-9. The King himself
was no bad craftsman at a sonnet (Ibid.‚ 148), and could write a sprightly letter (Ibid, 153).
This poem is a happy anticipation of the keynote with which that great “ New-Year Ode '' of
Dryden to Chancellor Hyde commences :—

“ While flattering crowds officiously appear
To give themselves, not you, a happy year ;
And by the greatness of their presents prove
How much they hope, but not how well they love,” etc.

ARGUMENT.

'Tis the feast-day ofJanus. What offering can we, thevotaries of Phoebus,
bring? Some affect‚ as gifts for kings, scarlet and purple robes, or gems, or
fine Molossian whelps or Thessaliam steeds of high pedigree, or the products
of Araby and India, and the unknown regions of the world, None of these
appertains to Helicon ; that region belongs to a land which has only crags and
shades and barren laurels. If Ι possessed those treasureS‚ I should try to offer
them. Superfluous task, as if we offered light to the sun or spangles to the
sky. To take oaks to Ida is a madman's task‚ and such a one would rather
need the physician‘s care. But, if the offerer has sound mind, there is a crafty
purpose latent in the gift, which is a hook or snare to catch thee by, as if the
present of a calf was meant to educe in return an ox. But Heaven forbid that
Johnston should pollute his thoughts with such a baseness. I wish only,
that, whatever help was promised to my Muse, may come spontaneously.
