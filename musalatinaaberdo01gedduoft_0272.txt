XXXVII. ΟΝ THE NOSE oF A CERTAIN PERSON FURNISHED wmz
A VERY LARGE PROBOfflHS.

(A jeu d’esprit of playsul fancies, and found in Ed. of 1632.)

Compare the Epigram on “nose of Ned,'' ending with “Poor Ned belongs to it,
instead of it belonging to poor Ned''. Thoms Traditions, p. 76 (Camd. Soa).

ARGUMENT.

 

In this tomb lies the biggest of Noses : anything may perish, when this
decays. It could serve as a trumpet‚ or a pfflughshare, a bellows for a i
Lemnian [blaeksmith's] forge, and various other uses it could subserve. It
could guide the way like a ship’s beak, or the antennae of a snail. A double
cloaca [sewer] it supplied, such as might suffice for the folk of Romulus.
Soft and rubicund, it was flexible, and from it emanated dews and odours.
A Spanish coney or a mole could have found a home in it. It was a Nose
unique, but Naso, its possessor, was†-a nobody.
