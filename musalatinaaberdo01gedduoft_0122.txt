own sun went down in sorrow, in the marvellous revolutions of time,
her offspring in the course of two generations ultimately carne to fill, as
they now do, the British throne. Born in Scotland in 1596, she was
named after the virgin queen of England, and, after the accession of her
father to the English throne, she was entrusted to the tuition of Sir John
Harington, who has left many notices of her and her surroundings, and who,
with the famous virtuoso the Earl of Arundel, accompanied her on her
wedding journey in 1613 to her castle Palatine of Heidelberg. At the time
of the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 it is said the conspirators intended to kidnap
her and to put her on the throne, thus imitating but reversing the policy which
had been used to separate King James from his own mother Queen Mary
(Nichols' Progresses‚ IV. 1068).

The most remarkable feature in the history of this princess is the
spel] she exercised over chivalric and noble natures, not one but many,
whence her appellation, the “Queen of Hearts'‘. To this spell responded
not only warriors like the three Haigs of Bemersicle (James Grant's Hepburn,
p. 15) who fell fighting in her behalf, but even unsuccessful suitors for her
hand, such as Gustavus Adolphus and Christian, administrator of Brunswick
(who was her first cousin, his mother being sister to Anne of Denmark, Eli-
Zabeth's mother, Coxe, Austm'a, ΙΙ. 183 n.). The latter warrior inscribed his
sword with the motto “ Fiir Gott und fu'r Sie‚“ i.e., “For God and for Her,'’
meaning the princess (Green’s Lives, V. 387). Nor could anything be finer
than worthy Sir Thomas Roe's expression of devotion in his humorous letter
—trying to smile through his tears over her missortunes :—

“The news of this town [Amsterdam] is that the air is in the first
degree, their ditches in the next, their beer in the third, and their heads in
the last degree—muddy‚ And lest I be infectecl therewith, to-morrow, by
God's grace, I will get into salt water.

“ Almighty God balance your sufferings with His blessings, for when I
can do no more 1 will pray heartily for you; so do thousands‚ and there-
fore nothing is worth acceptance that comes from your majesty's unfruitful,
humble, honest, east-west-north-cr›ni-south servant'‘ (Green's Lives, V. 473).

It was in 1630 that her brother, Charles Ι. of England, had a son born to
him by Henrietta Maria of France, an event which blocked the way against
Elizabeth and the English succession. Both Frederick and Elizabeth
cordially welcomed their brother's infant son, though he diverted the line
of succession from themselves and their offspring. According to Oldmixon,
however, the joy in England was not universal; there were mutterings that
there were Plotestant heirs enough to the crown in the flourishing offspring
