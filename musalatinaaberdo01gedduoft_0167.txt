 

APOLOGY FOR THAUMANTIA. 129

so Thaumantia's art. She saved my life as well; else I had gone the way
of all the earth, had my loved ones perished. The commonwealth has got
many good soldiers and citizens through her helping hand, which might have
else done much mischief to lith and limb of the city's infant progeny. Not
Salpe nor Lais more skilful. Had her help been of old, Piso had preserved
his spouse, and (Caesar) Caligula had not lamented his wife’s funeral, nor
would the dying Julia have disturbed the honours of her husband, if Rome had
possessed one such aged dame. But, alas, on her the arm of the Law-Court
falls heavy. Alcmaeo is thought impious, and Nero is reckoned unnatural,

. each as a son injuring his mother, and Orestes got his vision of the Furies

haunting him for being cruel to a mother. Alas! ye Bailies, Ι sear that
Scotland will account you among that company, so long as the fatherland
brings a crop of children forth, and while the assisting mother to the com-
munity is locked up in darkness. What losses else must we have sustained ,Ρ
The race of the Menzies, of the Rutherfords, the Collisons, CullenS, etc„
would otherwise have had no succession! Why refer to you, O [Duncan]
Liddel! or the Cargill brothers, or Wedderburn, a match for both? Had
such restrictions been of old, there had been no race of heroes. The world is
growing worse, when (Diana) Prothyraea and her handmaids are despised.
I fear Cupid may now wing his way out of the world altogether. There will
be no blandishments of the sexes now. A Town Council (of Rome) once
forbade matrons to use carriages, and made them trudge through mud, but
they were soon brought to their senses by the weaker sex through retaliatory
measures‚ denying to their lords conjuga] rights. The Seniors, therefore, have
to recall their decree. Possibly, the maidens may rise, and, axe in hand,
Amazonlike, reclaim the elderly dame, and then there will be a general serim-
mage. What sort of a town will the city then become, with brickbats fiying ?
Better grant the matron's prayer, ere it come to serious ill. She will enrich
the city with offspring, whereof Sparta or Rome may be proud, a race of future
governors. By way of accusation, it is the dame's petulance of tongue that
is complained of. A fault it is, but no woman is without it : as well may we
deny sparkle to the stars. The tongue is woman’s weapon, as much as the
club served Hercules, or the spear Achilles. The Egyptian midwives told
lies, but the infirmity was, in them, condoned, and Deity commended their
Lueiferian, to light-bringing, art. Take out therefore from the dark lockup
her who brings so many from darkness to the light'of day. Should she die
a victim of the law in prison-gloom, be this the distich on her grave: “The
old woman that lies here had a tongue for which she deserved to die, but a

deft hand that earned a right to live ”.
