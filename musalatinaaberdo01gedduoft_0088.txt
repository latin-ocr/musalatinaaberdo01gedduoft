thou didst pledge thyself that Elbe and Danube would run backwardd' to their
native hills ere thou shouldst prove untrue. They run as before, and all
continues the same. Not so thou. When Helen sinned, she blushed and
fled. Thou showest a brazen face and fliest at thy husband’s throat.
Agamemnon, no doubt, paid the penalty sor his unfaithfulness. But where
was my offence, save the being pious and seeking to punish sacrilegious
men? The irreligious Phlegyas, Sisyphus and the like, are warnings.
But why this disruption in regard to sacred ntes, which with me boast
sixteen centuries of confinuance, while your ritual is but of yesterday, and you
may cast it offto-morrow ? Such, or the like, were my pleadings, I remember
well, but my pleadings had no force. The nuptial union betwixt our houses
is now three centuries old. Thou hast sought a foreign spouse. Alas!
words must give way to the bolts of Mam, and it is a war of selfdefence.
My allies from East and West are many, and strong. And where are thine ?
Perhaps the Ruler of the Northern Waves will lend thee aid. Sooner will
the oak yield wine, the vine-tree acorns, ere [James 1.] the ‘⁴ Pacific King”
venture on such daring. But perhaps the uncle [Denmark's king] promises aid.
He will remain safe among his fens. The Spaniard seeks revenge on thee,
and thou, too, kingdom of Leon, art fierce because of recent hurts received.
But granting thou hast troops, where is their commander ? Not surely that
Adonis of thine, for whom the harp is more appropriate than the sword. Oh,
that thy hard heart would telem, O Biomea [Bohemia]l There would then
be peace and plenty. Religion would be restored, and bring blessing with
it. As Orpheus went down to Hades for his Eurydice, so would I face death
a thousand times to get thee back again.
