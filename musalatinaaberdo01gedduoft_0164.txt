XX. A SPHINX [RIDDLE] TO PRINCE CHARLES.

This elever jeu d’esprit is intended for a riddle, giving what we take to be a shadowy

account of the metamorphosis of the flax plant into tapestry for kings' palaces. The descrip-
tion appears fairly accurate even at the present day, except that flax is now pulled, not shorn.
Α near parallel* in subject and allegorical treatment is Burns⁷¹ ‘John Barleycorn'& As early
as 1580, Humphry Gifford' s riddle 1n his Ροςίι is in the same vein (Grosart' s Miscell., 1. ): —
“ Not long am I granted this life to enj0y‚

So many there are that work me annoy;

O Lord, how they rent me! it cannot be told

What torments I suffer in heat and in cold:

One while I am drowned; such hap doth befal.

Then next do they roast me: yet this is not all τ

When thus they have used me, they cannot sorbear me,

Ere first being beaten, by piecemeal they tear me.

Then serve 1 the turn of every estate,

But one kind ofpeople me deadly doth hate !''
H. Gifsord’s own answer is “ Hemp”.

Johnston's poem appears first in ed. '37, and a question arises, who is the Charles to
whom it is dedicated ? The occurrence of Princeps and not Rex might seem to point
to the Charles who afterwards became Charles II.‚ born in 1630, and to whom Johnston
composed a poetical greeting among the “ Icones Regiae ’' (Vol. ΙΙ.). The age of the young
prince at that date, however, appears to forbid the supposition.

ARGUMENT.

The sun is my sire, and my mother the daedal earth. By a female hand
I fell when scarce well grown. Deaths more than one besell me; my head,
torn from its shoulders‚ was consigned to the flames by a rustic crowd. The
body that remained was bound in chains and steeped in water. Thence
dragged out, I am bleached in the sun, and lie unburied on the plain. Cruel
fellows then fell to me with flails and beat both my flanks. Then, Ixionlike,
I am tossed and twisted on the wheel. A torturer thereafter snatches up and
binds my broken limbs, and keeps me down with weights tied to my toeS.
Nor is there yet an end to my woes: with weapons wielded by female hands
I am pricked and assailed; I am slashed by scissors. My wounds are as
many as the pangs of love that shoot through a young man’s breast. In a
thousand ways my lacerated frame is scourged, and Vulcan’s anvils receive
lighter knocks than Ι. Through all this sad experience I come preserved, O
prince, as a holiday-gift of what value soever, to adorn thy halls. Looked at
by myself‚ Ι put my intrinsic worth as nil, and no one can give a thing less in
value than Ι am; but if you look at me as the offering of bright, pure hearts,
Ι put my worth as all the world ; no one has given or can give more.
