88 PARERGA.

our sovereign does our eye repose; it now rests upon an urn ; the father of
his country has sunk into a shade. One tide of Death sweeps all along.
Yet we mourn a premature demise. Bohemia had to be liberated‚ and his
daughter and son-in-law‚ with his grand-children, should have been reinstated
in their hearths and homes. While preparing for war, Death overtook him,
whose life had been illustrious by the arts of Peace. Bellona's wish was to
transfer the glorious title to his son. That son was not ashamed to fight
under his father's lead, like Achilles under Atrides’ banner, or Hector under
his father Priam's, neither of whom felt his dignity thus diminished. Nor
shouldst thou, CharleS, have felt thus, under a greater chief than was either
Grecian prince or Trojan. He is gone, not to be recalled. The deaths of
three nobles, viz„ two Dukes of Lennox1 and one Marquis of Hamilton, are
premonitory of calamity. Thirty days have visited us of gloom and rain,
bringing back the Deluge, and floods in his native Forth. Disasters have
come by sea and land, to husbandmen and sailors. A charmed life he had
led: escaping the assassin’s dagger, and the subterranean saggot. The dire
city of Rome threatened him with destruction both as man and boy. He
hath perished, scion of a hundred and six kings, a prince who reigned as
many Olympiads as there are changes of the Zodiac in a year, one who, besides
native genius, had culture srom a Master who brought immortal fame to Scotia
[Buchanan]‚ and was replete with such stores of knowledge, mundane and
Attic as well. The guardian of right and law in his three realms at home,
he was counsellor of peace abroad. Under him was pastoral and rural peace
and felicity, “the rush-bush kept the flock,” and Tityrus, the herdsman,
could beguile the day with love and song. His subjects were richer than
himself3 placable and mild and chaste; he spent aught of leisure in study
or the chase, a votary of Diana. His services to the Psalter: his work on
Training and Education (⁶⁴ Basilikon Doron ’')‚ all show that he was pious, and
given to Theological study, in defence of the Faith. Thus he lived, and
came to offer up his last breath, with prayer to Heaven to receive his spirit.
Then addressing his son, Charles: “ O Prince‚” said he, “hear and fulfil
thy father’s vows. So shall thy days fiow on without a cloud, and Britain
will have no cause to mourn thy sire.”

¹ Ludovick, Second Duke of Lennox, died 16th February, 1624, and, leaving no issue,
was succeeded by his brother, Esme, Third Duke of Lennox, who did not long enjoy the
dignity, dying suddenly of spotted ague 3oth July‚ 1624. The Second Marquis of Hamilton
died in the same month with the King (2nd March, 1625).
