XLIV. TO ROBERT BARON, DOCTOR OF DIVINITY, CON- ³

CERNING THE DEATH OF HIS INFANT SON.

(In No. XLI„ p. 249, some account is given of tlzsisfamous Theologian.)

ARGUMENT.

In sorrow you are now weeping‚ men say, within the confines ofAberdeen, ,
over your son's death. Tears are not to be forbidden ; they are natural to man, ,
appropriate to a father. Tears relieve the strain of grief. But yet there is a ÷
mean in tears; the dew upon the cheek should not be moist for ever. King 1

David felt the same pang: compose thyself by his example to a calm serenity.

Be it yours, O Baton, to follow the poet-king, who, while hope was, fasted ,

and prayed, but, when the blow fell, rose and anointed himself and took re-

and the wound should now begin to heal, since it is no new wound to you who
have lost children before ; but, alas l this was your heir, and so the hope ofyour

priest? and who were ever baser than his sons? So with David and his ³
sons: only one rivalled his sire; yea, of Isaac's twin sons one degenerated. ἶ

But suppose him worthy of yourself, there is still less ground for weeping. Are 2
you sad because he is now across life’s sea and in quiet rest? Are you sad ᾗ

because he has emerged from prison, or, as a debtor, has paid his debt before ἱ

it was due; as a warrior, has gained the victory over death? Safe in Abra· ι

harn's bosom, he now surveys the four-square golden city, where is the silver- j 1

white throne, underneath which flows the river which is clear as crystal. On ⁸
either side is the 'I'ree with ambrosial fruits all-healing; and there is no ξ
