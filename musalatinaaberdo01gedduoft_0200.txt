158 PARERGA.

emigrating to fat Ireland [pinguem Iernen, l. 85], or off he goes to the
continental wars, helping Dutchman against the Spaniard, or France against
the Empire, and returning again victorious, with titles and a heavy purse. At
horne too arms are furbished out by hungry men, and each needy one flies at
his better-off neighbour's throat. No fear of punishment: 'tis all the same
whether one dies by famine or by hanging. “ But‚'’ you say, “the law of
Parliament forbids forestalling.” Baldus loves the law; but, when there is
the golden hope of gain, good-bye to law. Law is like the spider's web,
which catehes flies and lets swallows through, “ Through lzawking of this
sort the Moors were expelled.’' Yes; but see how Spain, by expelling
traders in corn, yet rules East and West. In vain the (mystie) Puritans
assail Baldus. He heeds not their arrows nor those of Jove. Confession
at death-bed will suffice; and there is, you know, the encouraging case of
the penitent thies. In some points Baldus is like the Harpies: in others they
are more reputable than he. Envied indeed he is, but then envy or dislike
attends virtue as its shadow. For curses he cares not, and is not concerned
for any spendthrift grandson. A just Aristides and a glorious Pericles
die without offspring to inherit their renown. F ollow our friend’s example
and live for the present, leaving the future to a higher Power.
