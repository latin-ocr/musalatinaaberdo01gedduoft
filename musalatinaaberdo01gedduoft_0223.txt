ΟΝ RUPTURE BETWEEN FRANCE ANI) SCOTLAND. 181

favoured thee, defending with thee but one cause, and facing one foe. Many
the captains sent to thee from the northern clime. From a long array take
as an example the blood-bedewed field of Bange, where Scots were champions
for France against a foreign yoke. At that time Bourges alone remained
to the throne of France, the sole city owning its sway. To save thy tumbling

’ throne, a royal auxiliary came from Scotland and protected the Lilies from the

Double Roses. Nay, what surpasses all belief, the Scots resisted their own
king’s commands, when, a captive infant [James 1.] , he was led to the war by
his captor. In many a well-fought field our help was lavished: witness our
slaughtered chiefs at Verneuss, and thence came the grant of citizenship in
France to every born Scot. The axes of the Scottish guard protected the
French throne. Not under Mars alone, but under the Muse as well, France
owes much to Scotia. Yea‚ Juno, who presides over royal nuptials so oft
exchanged, should have been bail against such rupture. Our prince Charles
is wedded to a daughter of France [Henrietta Maria] even now. In the pre-
sence of proud Spain, now thundering on the Elbe and subduing the prince
of the Rffine, let there be peace betwixt the [Scottish] Lion and the Lilies.
Louis, look to thy fronfiers, menaced by the Spaniard all around ; nor do thou,
Chanes, trust to thy three kingdoms and their protecting waves. Should the
Dutchman or the Dane succumb to Spain, one safety or one ruin await's you all.
