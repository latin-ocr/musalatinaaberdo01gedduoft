IX. ELEGY ΟΝ DEATH OF JAMES 1.‚ THE “PACIFIC,”
KING OF GREAT BRITAIN‚ FRANCE, AND IRELAND,
AND DEFENDER OF THE FAITH.

This poem belongs, therefore, to the year 1625. An edition, with dedication to Sir
Geo. Hay, Chancellor of Scotkmd, appeared in 4t0 (pp. 10), with the Latin title, ‘⁴ Autore
Arturo Ionstono, Medico Regio. Londini, impensis Nath. Butter, 1625.‘’ 1

The obverse to this splendid Title [Pacificus] of King James Ι. is seen in the actual
Pasquils of the Period. A Spanish caricature os the tIme is thus described :—

A messenger brings news to the King of Spain “ that the Palatinate was to have a very for-
midable army shortly on foot : Denmark would furnish 100,000 picked herrings; the Dutch 100,000
butter-boxes‚ and England 100,000 ambassadors. And they picture the King in one place with
a scabbard without a sword; in another place, with a sword that nobody could draw out,
though divers stand pulling at it. At Brussels they painted him with his pockets hanging
out, and never a penny in them, nor in his purse turned upside down. In Antwerp they
pictured the Queen of Bohemia like a poor Irish mandet, with her hair hanging about her ears,
and her child at her back, with the King, her father, carrying the cradle aster her. . . . Such
scorns and contempts were put upon the King, and in him on the whole nation.'' (Ar.
Wilson‚ History, p. 192.) Speaking of the “slackness of the Elector's nearest allies‚'’ a
contemporary writes: “ If your Lordship did heare what every bad companyon doth speake
here of our great master [James 1.], it would make your hair stand upright‚ and your eyes
(as mine do many times) gush out with streames of teares ”. (Laertem, etc. (Camd. Soc.), p.
67.) Schiller accordingly says sarcastically of the claim to the Crown of Bohemia: “ Even
King James of England preferred to see his son-in-law deprived of this crown, than that the
sacred majesty of kings should be outraged by so dangerous a precedent''. (Thirty Υιίινει

¹ Fine rebuke to King James by Robert Ayt0n‚ who, in his poem ‘⁴ De rebus Boemicis‚’'
has this closing couplet (Delitiae‚ I. p. 77) :—
“ Hac ratione potes justus Rex forte videri,
Sed non crudelis non potes esse Pater‘'.

A later condemnationis that os ChurchiH, in his terrible portrait of King James
(Gothum, Book 11.): “Vain os the scholar, he forgot the Prince‚⁷' etc., and of Thomson
(Libmty, IV.): “Abandoned Frederick pined‚ and Raleigh bled ”. Aper contra is found in
Isaac D'Israeli's apologetic estimate of King James, and in Maidment's Presace to the
Abbotssord Club Vol. of King James's Lcttm, etc.
