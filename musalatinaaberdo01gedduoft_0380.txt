deen ; Mr. W. R. Walke-r‚ St. Louis; Dr. John Webster‚
Aberdeen. All of these in their several ways were, more or less,
accomplished members of the Club, and are deeply regretted.

The Earl of Caithness, as Mr. James Augustus Sinclair,
had on two occasions acted as one of the Auditors of the Club.

Mr. Murray Garden had from the outset been a Member
of the Council.

Mr. Hamilton of Skene and Dr. Maitland Moir were
known to be excellent archaeologists‚ and judicious collectors
of objects antiquarian.

In the decease of the Rev. Dr. Mearns and Professor
Smith-Shand we lose links of connection with the former pro-
fessoria] and ecclesiastical memories of this portion of Scotland.

Dr. Webster, one of the founders of the old Spalding Club,
was a Vice-President and a Member of the Business Committee.
This Club, as well as the City and the University‚ feels itself
poorer by the loss of one possessed of so rich culture and so
varied accomplishments.

One of the names in the above list of deceased members de-
serves and must receive a special tribute of regretful remembrance.
It is that of Charles Elphinstone Dalrymple, one of the Vice-
Presidents‚ as well as the first Chairman of the Editorial
Committee—a gentleman by whose death, it is not too much to
say, the Club has met with the severest loss it has yet sustained.
His well-known accomplishments as a scholar and archaeologist,
his great stores of local knowledge and history in this northern
district, his fine literary taste and gentlemanly feeling, all combined
to form a most attractive character, such as we can hardly hope
to see exemplified soon again. To him, more perhaps than
to any other single member, has the resuscitation of the Spalding
Club in its new form been due, and, in expressing its regret
for his loss, it has to mourn the severance of a most im-
portant and valued link uniting the New Club to the Old.
