HIS LAWSUIT AT MALINES. 113

i XIV. ELEGIAC APPEAL To THE REVEREND AND RIGHT

HONOURABLE NICOLAs DU FIEF, COUNSELLOR
l IN THE HIGH COURT OF MECHL1N‚ WHEN SEN-
l TENCE WAs To BE GIVEN.1

ARGUMENT.

Thrice three months have I had of tossing in the Sea of Lawsuit. Yet
land is near, but the shore brings shipwrecks oftener than does the wide sea.
Sometimes a vessel sinks at the harbour mouth. O Du Fief, l‘end thine aid

and guide my course aright. One mariner may look to the polestar, another
to the Cynosure3 but thou art to me my Castor and Pollux. IfI am wrecked
at last, let my head be hid on these shores, and be this the inscription on my
tombstone: “ Fleeing from Caeus's cave, Johnston is killed (O shame) by the
very altar where he seeks refuge ”.

¹ In Parerga of 1632, the title is a short one: “Ad Nic. Fifum, Consiliarium‚ cum sen-
tentia esset ferenda ⁷³. On Du Fies see No. XVIII., and on the whole matter No. XIII.
