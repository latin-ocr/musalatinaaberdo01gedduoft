ARGUMENT.

What shall I seek or shun? I am in a puzzle. Virtue is deemed
a crime, and per contra, “ Daulius,’' for giving a wipe to the mouths of
Jews, is taken to the bar. ‘Twas not thirst for gold that urged him: a
pious feeling was the prompting cause. For when God brought Israel ⁴
out of Egypt, He bade them bring with them the riches of the Nile. Ι
The rapine was just: Egypt, with its hard ruler and taskmaster‚ suffered, ’
because stained with Hebrew blood. The fate of Memphis, then incurred‚
the circumcised people now deserve. They dared to pierce with spear the
side of the supreme. Such doom they drew on themselves by their deed
of guilt, as their own prophets did declare, and “ Daulius'' has but proved
their own prophets true. Yet his avenging ire fell far short of the guilt. J*
Instead of slaying, he only stripped them. As a Scot he was entitled to
reprisals, being of the blood of “Scota,'’ daughter of the Egyptian king.
And now, from her seed on the cold northern soil, upsprings an avenger ,Α

Jews: they are so full of eyes and cunning of fence. But “ Daulius '’ threw
glamour over their eyes, and the twelve tribes became a prey. An in-

cheat the honest ox: no harm to trap the wolf or the fox, or to birdlime the Ἰ
hawk. Run over the roll of crafty deeds ofold : they but enabled weakness to J
cope with might and violence. Ulysses for his wiles was more honoured than ,ἶ
Ajax for his brute force. Yea, and the wiles of gods are not unknown; and
Jove has his exploits in this vein as well. Jove was amorous, but the chaste *i
‘⁴ Daulius ’' pursued another kind of game. He would relieve an overburdened 2¹³
