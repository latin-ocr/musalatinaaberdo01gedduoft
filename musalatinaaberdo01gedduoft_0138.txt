XII. A DIATRIBE ΟΝ SAILORS, ADDRESSED TO THE
CHANCELLOR OF SCOTLAND, GEORGE HAY.

Because of the loss of his wardrobe. sustained at the hands os certain Marium-s, the
Poet launches out into various maledictions. Contrast with this the more genial strain
toward sailors of No. XXII. Latin Title in Pam-rga os ‘32 is: “Ad Cancellarfflm, ut in
Nautas‚ ob expilatam arcam vestiariam, animadvertat”.

ARGUMENT.

O Hay! presiding over Caledonian Law, hear a bard’s complaint‚ and
hear it promptly. The petitioner should have come bending humbly to
present his suit: but he cannot, he is naked, and has no clothes to enwrap
his limbs. The Naiad in the fountain and the Graces have more vestments.
Not more naked were Cupid, Thetis, Venus, before the Phrygian shepherd,
or the same goddess, when sailing in her conch over the waves. Not the
red Priapus nor the Cyclop at his forge more nude, or Ulysses when cast on
the Phaeacian shore. None more naked ever entered or quitted the breathing
world. You ask the cause. Well : the patient when consulting the physician
unfolds his wounds and recounts the smart.

'Tis an earth—born race that is the guilty cause, a raee that plies its craft
amid the waters; black pitch clings to them, and they creep like monkeys
among the sails and shrouds, a race barbarous and faithless as their element
the sea. To them I committed my wardrobe when bound for the Thames‚
and it disappeared by no shipwreck, but through the captain’s pitchy paws.

A race of pilferers‚ these sailors are from the beginning-witness the
stealers of the Golden Fleeoe, the experience of Aristippus, the adventure of
Bacchus with the Tyrrhene pirates, so grimly avenged by their transformation
into finny fishes‚ the incidents that besell Arion.

But why dwell on these old dead legends? Ι want, O Hay! living
Justice to the tender Muses. The genius of song may burst out in
satire as against a LycambeS, but of what use is satire wasted on these folk
who cannot read a line? Nor do Ι claim restoration—the clothes will have
now contracted the not nice stench of pitch. You, however, have power of
Fire and Water, Gallows and hanging naked in chains, or tearing by wild
horses (the fate of Metius), or “Boots,’‘ and bowstring, or the hook, or,
among other punishments, the wheel! The whole armoury of Themis is
not too severe against the men who have robbed a Bard.
