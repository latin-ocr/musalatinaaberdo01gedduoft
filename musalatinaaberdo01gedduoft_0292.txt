250 PARERGA.

‘¹ Robertus Baro,’' as he is there called, styles himself “ Scotus, Fintraeus ''. John Leech
Leochaeus, p. 19) has an epigram (not in good taste) addressed “Ioanni et Roberto Baronio,

consobrinis suis ''.
It is unfortunate that to these literary notices of the theologian we cannot append any
counterfeit presentment of the man, no portrait of him by Jamesone being known to exist—a

lacuna greatly to be regretted.

ARGUMENT.

Behold, friend Baron, this production, full of rural rusfiness, which Ι send
you from the banks of the Gadie. Far from town, a small and poor farm de-
tains me, and I must drudge with Ceres' oxen, neglecting Phoebus and the
Muses. With crooked back Ι bend over the plough, and have to ply the goad
and shout to the brute beasts; the harrow and the rake Ι have to use in turn.
Here Ι have to disbone the earth of stones; there Ι have to drain the ground
with ditch or irrigate it with a watercourse. Threshing the corn wearies my
arms; digging with the spade, my feet. With three-pronged “ graip '' (l. 17) I
spread manure in the furrow. In early spring I sow the seed, and in autumn
reap under Arcturus' star. Part of the crop has to be kiln-roasted and bruised
with stone: part has to be steeped in flowing waters. Fuel for the winter
eold has to be dug up in the summer heats. In raking into earth’s bowels, L
rasp upon the under-world. Cares come trooping like waves. Hardly have
I shut my eyes at midnight‚ when I am wakened by chanticleer. Rising, Ι
don shaggy hides, and breakfast on parsnip (turnip) and water. My life is a
wretched life, and I am not what Ι was; grey hairs appear. Muddy feet,
drooping head, unkempt beard, horny hands make me a fright to myself.
“ Dool '‘ upon the man who recommends the streams of Gadie to soften the
human frame. Like Battus under the caduceus, like Phineus at the sight of ’
the Gorgon, my frame congeals to stone, whence I might serve as a new theme ι
to the poet of the Metamorphoses. This might be endured; but, alas! my
mind grows indurated and brutish in sympathy with the body. My talk is
only of ploughs and bullocks. 1 have lost the cunning of Latin verse, as this
production shows. Examine it and remove the warts and knots. My ambi· ,
tion is not for wealth of harvests or store of fat cattle. I wish to be able to ¹

quit Gadie and this remote nook of the world.
