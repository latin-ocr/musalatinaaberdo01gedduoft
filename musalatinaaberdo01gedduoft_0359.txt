EPISTLE To GORDON or CRAIG. 305

LI. AD GORDONIUM CRAGACHINDORIUM.

Siccine, Gordoni, Cabriis affixus ericis‚
Urbe procul, rupes inter et antra lates?

Quid iuvat ingenio genium vicisse Minervae,
Ingenii dotes si sinis usque premi?

Quid iuvat Aoniae fontes siccasse cohortis,
Si fruitur studiis Cabria sola tuis?

Quid prodest, mores hominum vidisse vel urbes,
Nulla tuam si res publica sentit opem?

Hic ubi tu latitas, nil, praeter lustra ferarum,
Et caeli volucres, saxaque surda, vides. 10

Nullum hic, qui doctas haurire aut reddere voces,
Aut a te quidquam discere possit, habes.

Barbara gens tota est, et inhospita terra, pruinis
Semper, et aestivo sub Cane, mersa nive.

Ah fuge, nec populis nec amicas frugibus oras,
Et procul hinc, Musis et tibi quaere larem.

1. Cabriis.] i.e.‚ belonging to or adjoining Cabrach. This famous parish, one of the
most remote in Aberdeenshire, adjoins the parish of Auchindoir. Besides possessing a hospit-
able and hard-headed people, who have to carry on a great struggle with Nature, it is a
parish 1 unique in this respect, that, in common parlance (as old as 1435, in Lord Crawford's
Earldom of Mar, Ι. p. 2583 as well as in Scott‘s Bridc of Lammermoor, ch. 93 Antiqztczzy,
eh. 26), it can claim a distinction of its own, being known as The Cabrach. It therefore ranks
above a parish, as if a district or province,2 like “ The Enzie‚” ‘⁴ The Garioch‚” ‘⁴ The
Mearns,’' etc.

¹ Birse was once similarly known as “ The Birse‚” but the feeling of its being originally
a descriptive appellative has in this case died out, as has happened also in “Irvine of the

Drum,’' Antiqs., 11. pp. 75, 78.
2Ιῐι Οοίῐεειίοιις (Spald. Club)‚ p. 108, Auchindoir and Cabrach are couplcd as a district
by themselves, not included under the other districts of Aberdeenshire.
