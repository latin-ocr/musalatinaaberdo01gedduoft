COUNSEL LEARNED IN THE LAW.

ARGUMENT-

My greetings to you, Nicolson, with a petition for your timely interest
and aid according to our mutual bond of friendship to stand, each by the
other, in time of need. 1 have been victimised. My little farm and thatch-
covered house have been reft away, and the robber threatens likewise my
life. My cause, please to support in the forensic arena. It does not need
Nestor’s flow of words or Ulysses' terse eloquence, but like as that wherewith
Jupiter quelled Enceladus, one peal of thunder from thy lips, such as has
oft startled the law-courts of the city by the Forth, will discomfit my foe. The
fite-breathing monster is worthy of your prowess. Meleager and Hercules both

, triumphed over brute beasts‚ and other heroes have vanquished gorgons and
snakes. My foe is one of many monsters rolled into one, and such will be the
triumph over one, who is a Cyclop, and something more.
