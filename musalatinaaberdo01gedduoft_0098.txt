64 PARERGA.

As a Lion is better liked than Vultures‚ so is Eliza's majestic power than that
of Saravicto [Austria]. My realm is small, but the people are warlike; under
a blind general [Ziska] they twice foiled thy ancestors. That same warrior
gave his skin to be tanned to form a drum. Such is our land, and so expect
it to deal reeling shocks to overthrow thee. Nature will droop and change
before tyrants thrive. Vengeance of Phoebus is preparing such punishment as
fell on the Python ; on Tityus, a criminal like thee; on Agamemnon. Yet slow is
the 'pacex nothing great or memorable is done quickly: Hercules was not
engendered in one night, and elephants take ten years to develop. The
panic-terror thou dost conjure up is vain. The realm of the Lion (?James
V1., Scottish Lion) is safe. Holland is secure, with all domestic feuds
assuaged ; Spain with its snowy Lion (Leon), that once preyed thereon‚ will
be in turn the victim. The Meuse will send aid, the martial race of Bouillon
from Sedan; also Auvergne and Bourbon. The Imperial eagles shall bend
before the standards of the ruler of Sedan. As for reproaches against our ruler
or commander‚ why, a captain surely can possess accomplishrnents. Witness
Alexander and Caesar—both votaries of culture. Like Perseus, the prince
has come to rescue his Andromeda; or, he comes as Hercules, who drove
the evil birds from Arcady. How grand this captain, who now, in my spouse's
absence, rising superior to the clouds of envy, makes Rhine and Ister stepping-
stones in his triumphant march! But why contend in words any more?
Fulfil thine own vow, and get thee down to Hades, if thou wilt win my love;
and what thou doest‚ do quickly.
