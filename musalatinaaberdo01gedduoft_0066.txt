32 PARERGA.

law, the doctors have no chance of game on such a field. The folk are tough
and healthy. 1f a fellow has a sever, he cures himself with thejuice of (oats ?)
barley. So look for a field for your craft elsewhere. A neighbour nation,
across the sea, is ready for the sickle. 'Tis a people dwelling in ‘ Bog-land,’
and the folk there, dwelling in puddles, are a fertile prey.” So spoke the
nymph and vanished, leaving him distracted between hope and fear. Fear
gained the mastery; and away at length he hies, seizes a ship, and in three
days Zephyrus blew him to the wished-for shore. But who can reckon up
the exploits that followed, enriching the bills of mortality! The Spanish
plunderer of the seas had been a scourge severe, but the doctor's madness
was destined to let far more blood. The infernal stranger was surrounded by a
gaping crowd, who thought Phoebus himself was come, with Panacea and
health attending him. Crowds of patients flock to him like bees to their
waxy tenementS. Down sink prostrate both Mynheer and his wife, with their
“ marmots‚'’ and funerals corne thick and fast, and victims are tumbled into
one grave, and there lacks ground to bury them. The increase of deaths they
ascribe some to the fogs‚ or the bogs, or comets’ baleful influence: no one
dares to blame the doctor's drugs. When the people were nearly reduced to a
fourth, he prepares to shift his camp. Not far thence to the west is an
ancient realm parted off by a little strait. ’Tis the land subject to the golden
Lion, a brave and powerful people by land and sea. Thither rushes the son
of the wind, still in hope of plunder, but ignorant of the cleverness of this
people, he commences his career of trickery. Hither comes the stranger; says
one, he is from Arcady; says another, he is from Abdera; others say, he is
one of the Psylli, who made war on the winds. Many think him this, that,

and the other, revived; a Midas among the rest. Found out by this sharp- ¹

eyed race, he tries to hoodwink thern with juggles of words. Astrology too
he calls to his aid, and rattles over the names of the constellations and
planetary powers. He avers his own horoscope portends a sceptre: Caesar
and Alexander had a nativity with stars less favourable. Not content with
slaying the living, he assails the mighty “ Dead ”——nay, he emits poetry and
audaciously attempts a version of a Psalm of David. For such madness
there is no help or hope. His punishment must be left to an angry heaven.
