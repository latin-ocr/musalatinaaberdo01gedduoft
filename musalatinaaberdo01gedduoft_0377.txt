FIFTH REPORT ΒΥ THE COUNCIL.

Approved at tlte Fz'stlz annual General Meeting of tlw Clzcb on
Fridqy, 11th December, 1891.

THE Council feel it to be their duty to begin their Report by
explaining the circumstances under which the Annua] Meeting
of the Club has this year been held in December instead of
in October, as formerly.

It will be in the recollection of members that at the last
General Meeting of the Club, on 3oth October, 1890, it was
resolved to alter Rule III„ so as to admit of the holding of the
Annual Meeting “in the month of October or at such otlzer time
as may be found c07zve7zz'ent‘'. It was at the same meeting
announced that the Editorial Committee had approved, as part
of the issue for 1891, of the second volume of the Chartulary of
the Church of S. N icholas, edited by the Rev. James Cooper—
of which the first volume had appeared early in 1888. When it
was found, in the course of last summer, that this volume was
not making such rapid progress as had been anticipated‚ or
as was being made by the companion volume edited by Mr.
Cramond, it was thought expedient to take advantage of the new
rule by arranging for a Meeting of the Club at a somewhat later
period of the year, in the hope that both volumes might then be
in the hands of members. It is with much regret that the
Council find this expectation unfulfilled. Mr. Cooper reports
himself unable to carry out his intention of completing his
editorial work during the present year; and the CounciL there-
fore, feel that further delay in holding the Annual Meeting
would serve no good purpose.
