This poem is the sole example of continuous Heroic verse in the Parerga, or indeed
the Latin works of Johnston. All the rest are in Elegiae verse.

ARGUMENT.

Reveal‚ ye eternal fires, and constellations of the northern sky, reveal the
dread mystery, by whom was caused the dire burning of the Gordon heroes.
Indignity was therein added to horror. The remains of those who deserved a
tomb like Mausolus were tossed into stables among vile and musty straw, mere
mangled remains—trunks without extremities. Which of the old legends
of barbarity can equal this? Sad, and dire,2 and grim is that inhospitable
tower which blazed up in an instant and consumed the living men without the
fond tributes ofaffeetion at the final hour. Bright youths they were: one was
of the gentry; the other of the nobility ; the latter by his ancestral line touching
the royal race—both cut off in their prime. Ah! ere now the gallant pair
should have started it in the field of fame, quelling the proud erest of Spain
or clipping the talons of the Imperial Eagle by the banks of Rhine, where, O
France‚ the heir of Huntly thunders in arms within thy domain. That glory
is denied to us and them by this fell deed, whereat earth, sea and sky grew pale.
Alas, the degenerate days! No prowess among us Scotsmen now like that
which repelled Imperial Rome, subdued Pict and Dane, and gave victory to
Wallace and to Bruce, with whom stood in battle the Chieftain of the Hays.
Our warring now is by means of base weapons: by poison, by dagger, by
arson or clandestine fire, and the perpetrator is wrapt in darkness, such as
enshrouds the cradle of the Nile. O sacred Bench, presiding over the laws,
if there is any feeling in your breasts for right and justice, or pity for the
wretched, discover the criminal. Ye have every engine at command to extract
or extort the truth—the wheel‚ the boot, and the fire, the murderer's weapon.
For the honour of the Scottish name, let not justice plead in vain.

¹ Generally and popularly known as Lord Aboyne. The creation was Viscount os
Melgum and Lord Aboyne, 1627. (Sir R. Douglas‚ Peerage of Sc.)

²Compare Spalding’s ‘⁸ dolorous tower ''. The impression gathered from Spalding and
from Johnston is unsavourable to Lady Crichton.
