VII. BIOMEA TO SARAVICTOJ

BOHEMxA IN REPLY To AusTR1A. (See No. VI. p. 59.)

ARGUMENT.

Thy letter has been read, under no veto, as thou deemest, imposed by my
lord‚ but to what effect is such a missive ? ’Tis a painting to the life of thy
own misdemeanours. Superstition and fraud and many evil things are therein
only made more manifest. Usually vice shows not its face at the first, but
at the very threshold thou betrayest wickedness, vamping up the plea of
adultery. Proserpine was happy in her lot, suffering abduction‚ but not
losing her fame. How could Biomea have been false to thy bed, when she
was the spouse all the while of another lord ? No one can serve two masters.
True, violence supervened, and, like Troy, like Jerusalem, Ι succumbed.
Shall Ι reckon up the rapines of thy gathered crowns? The cruelties and
tortures and brutalities‚ worse than Nero’s, thou hast perpetrated ? The Elbe
and Ister are red with blood of mine shed through the impieties and im-
purities in thy train. Shall I mention thy idols of stone, thy manufacturing of
the Deity out of the wafer of flour and bran ? Who would deem that Lycaon
continued to be tolerated as a spouse, when once he was proved to be a wolf?
For Caesar's Imperial law Ι care not: like a bubble (Papal bull)‚ it perishes of
its own futility. But suppose that Ι am a subject; thou canst not be my lord.
Many of Caesar’s offspring have precedence of thee. The Dane has that prero-
gative, and what the Dane has, that Eliza [Elizabeth‚ Princess Palatine] con-
veys to my sponse. He, too, boasts Imperial ancestors, and as to rank and
positions‚ thou art, indeed, sceptre-bearem but he whose function is that of
viand-bearer was assigner of the sceptre to be borne. The Turk will stand in
awe of him as well : the Turk who has caused so many victories over thee.
But why pursue the nicely adjusted scales of reason? The great array of
peoples at thy side is empty show. WVhy expect aid from France or Thames?

of base neglect, Delitiae, 1. p. 70.
