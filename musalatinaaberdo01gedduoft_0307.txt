 

To ROBERT BARON, ΙΝ CONDoLENcE. 265

golden light of the sun needed there, or the silver light of the moon, but God
is the light shining everywhere. The things you call harsh, your son now
counts benign; and there he moves among the winged choirs and those in white
linen robed. A song divine upon his lips, andjoys without a cloud, repose with-
out an end. But why teaeh a Tiphys how to steer in a swell of waves, or an
Automedon to drive the rapid car? ’Tis your praise, O Baron, that you have the
art and skill to administer consolation and to sway the mind so as to turn
obedient to your spell. That power of yours I have felt myself in the hour
of mourning over lost dear ones. 'Tis a power, I believe, that can move
steel and stone. Seek not aught, therefore, beyond yourself. Either nobody
has, or you yourself alone posseSS, what can be of help to you.
