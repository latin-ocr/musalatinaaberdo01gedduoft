210 PARERGA.

Stultitiae poenas sed dedit ille suae.
Oceano ventisque diu iactatus, et astris
Adversis, tenui curn rate, sorptus aqua est. 110
His quoque, cum Dolago, Sthinoon mergetur in undis,
Praedaque ventosi fiet uterque freti.
Tunc ego te, liber tot corrivalibus‚ unus,
Sint modo Di faciles, Gariornarra, fruar.

as 1507, and possession by the Elphinstones continued till the great suit in 1624, when the
grant of 1507 was reduced.

111. Dolag0.] As a nominative, this is anagram for Douglas. By marriage with
Margaret, Countess of Mar, an Earl of Douglas became Earl of Douglas and Mar.

111. Sthinoon.] Anagrarn for IHONSTON. · The Johnstons ofCaskieben grew into note
as dependants of the older Earldom of Mar, before even the Stewart Earls os Mar were known,
and therefore long before the Erskines were recogm'sed as the heirs of the Earldom. They
even put forth pretensions to the Earldom itself‚ claiming through Margaret Garioch‚ heiress
of Caskieben, and wife of the First Johnston, known as ‘⁴ Stephen, the Clerk,'’ she being
grand-daughter of “ Elyne '² of Mar, and so conveying an older and prior claim than that
on which the Erskine family founded, for both claimed, on the female line, through “Elyne”

of Mar. Accordingly the Johnstons did not regard with complete favour the aspirations of

the Erskines. In proof may be cited a Deed of Ratification by King James IV., of “ a decreet
of the Lords, zoth Feb., 1502, finding the lands of Johnston to be holden of the King, and
not of the Earl of Mar ”. (Appendix to “Genealogical Account of Johnston Family‚”
Edinburgh‚ 1832, according to which, in 1628, Antiqs. (Sp. CL), IV. pp. 308-10, agreement
is come to, on certain understandings, as to Caskieben being held direct of the King, and
not of the [Erskine] Earl of Mar.) A fuller account of the Johnston claim, thus compro-
mised and settled, is given in the genealogical work entitled “Memoir of James Young
and Rachel Cruickshank” (Appendix‚ p. xxxix.). “Sir George Johnston of that Ilk,
Knight Baronet, bound himself to renounce all right and claim which he might have
through ‘umquhill Sir James Gareoche and umquhill Dame Helene of Mar, his alledgit
spouse, or any of them’—to the Earldom of Mar and Lordship of Garioch.”
