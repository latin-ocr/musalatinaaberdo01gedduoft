SATIRE 11. ON EGLISHEM. 31

ing of mankind. The Roman people had no doctors for six centuries, and
they multiplied and grew, till in the end luxury came, and with luxury the
doctor, the craft being introduced to prune their excrescent youth. This craft
thou must profess: throw all shame away, try all tricks to dazzle and deceive,
and have often on thy lip the sages of Cos and Pergamus. Put sear aside.
There is no crime in killing when one kills artistically.'' Thus spake the
Stygian Jove, and wild was the assenting acclaim. Onopordus is forthwith
transported to the fords of Cocytus, where Charon's bark was ready. In stept
the child of wind, but the weight was only Charon’s. Sweeping along by
shores lined with yew-trees and bloody mint, the skiff reaches the waters of
Styx, and Styx, recognising the child of father Acheron, smoothes its waves
in loyal greeting. Around the scene hovered owls, and harpyes, and shapes
obscene : frogs croaked and serpents shot out their tongues among the waters.
Thence the third pool was reached, that of Acheron. There, recognising his
natal spot, he looked at the strand and exclaimed: “There was the young
ass slain and skinned from which I took birth; this was the spot where Ι was
cradled “. A vast elm-tree rises near, shadowing dreams under its leaves, and
near by are shapes of monsterS, and diseases with all the ills flit around.
From the margin of this strand, where stands a poplar with double colour,
two ways diverge. One trends toward the Taenarian gateway from the halls
of Pluto; the other stretches away to lakes in a northern land. Where the
Maidens’ Rock looks to [Arcturus] Arthur-Seat, there lie standing pools, and
the water of [Lethe] Leith is not far remote. The “ Nor’ Loch '¹ is the vulgar
name, and it stinks like Avernus, concealing many crimes and swallowing
many miseries. It has a sluice into Acheron, and there Charon and his

ξ sreight emerged. With much ado the passenger was disgorged and landed;

reluctant he, but Charon was inexorable, and left the creature prone upon his
face and rubbing his eyes affected by the sunlight. When at length he looks
round with “ blintering ” eyes, a city meets the view stretched along the ridge
bordei-ing the pool: on one side a castle with wings (pennons), on the other
a palace, and houses everywhere. 'Tis a city rich and populous: thither he
wends his way. Fine field for new physician. But heaven interposed: a
nymph presented herself to him as he scoured along, and burst out with:
“Why so headlong, stranger? Mind your eyes, if you think to escape in
practising your funeral art among folks so dour. Look at my waters: there,
mark you, criminals are tossed as food to fishes. Not far off is the gallows
hung high against the sky, and there a gang of scoundrels are strung up as
food for fowls. The blind Lady, who looks after rights, reigns here, and
chops off heads, iron ‘ Maiden' that she is. But apart from the terrors of the
