Gallia Ioustouo celebris suit. Itur iu Arcton,
Grandiaquc Arturi uomina Scotus amat.
Crescit virtuti pretium. Sibi vendicat illum
Et Tamesis.- tautum possidet aula virum.
C larior invictis vates sub regibus audit,
Aoniasque levat purpura crebra Dcas.
Nunc Carolo meus ista vacat,· Regisque saluti
Dum studet, incolumi Principe quisque valet.
Sceptra canit sanatque simul. C um sata minantur,
Ille diem regi protrahit, illc decus. 10
Officium Medicina facit Phoebusque. Nec ostrum
Funus ab ingrata posteritate timet.
Vita duplex Regi conceditur. Una medentis,
Altera, vel Carolo iudice, vatis erit.
C. BARLAEUS.

CASPAR BARLAEUS IN PRAISE OF JOHNSTON'S POEMS.
(Only in Ed. Del. of 1637.)

Barlaeus was a Dutch scholar to whom Johnston paid a return compliment in Poem
No. XLVIII. We find Barlaeus a frequent correspondent os Scot of Scotstarvet, cf. especially
Nos. 2 and 24 in the Scotstarvet Collection of Letters (Adv. Libr. Edinb.). The latter contains

a poem on Scotstarvet's coat of armS. Note also an eulogium by Barlaeus direct to Scotstar-
vet, Del„ 1. p. 12. '

ARGUMENT.

After filling France with his farne, Johnston returned to his native north,
and finds his worth appreciated. Even the Tharnes attracts him, and the
Court is proud to possess him. The Muses with him wall< airily *on rich purple.
His mind is now devoted to King Charles‚ and in studying Itis health and weal,
he seeks and secures the weal of all. He lengthens the king's life by his heal-
ing art, and enhances the king's honour by his lays. As a son of Phoebus he
thus grants a double life : one by his medical craft; another, immortality, by
his poetic skill.

Line 4. Et Tamesis.] The Ed. Del. puts a period at illum, and seems to connect Tamcsts
as genitive after aula. The punctuation above seems correct.
