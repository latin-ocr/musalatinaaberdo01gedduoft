DEDICATIONS. 9

5. cmo.

Of old, Augustus' pious hand rescued from the flames the noble work of
the Mantuan bard. So from darkness Scot has rescued the poetry of the
northern race, himself a leader of Apollo's quire. Caesar gives eternity to
one poet; Scot to a thousand. Which of the two is greater?

6. POLYHYMNIA.

Under Augustus, the Tiber saw a thousand poets: a thousand are seen
born in James’ reign, and the Forth rolls poetic waters. No wonder. 'Tis
Peace gives life to the Latin Muse. Our king has been a guardian of snow-
white Peace, as much as Caesar.

7. MELPOMENE.

The preserves of a Lucullus show only the vast wealth of their luxurious
lord. Here you have tame fishes under the glassy water; there wild game
tempting as prey. Compare these with the work Scotstarvet patronises: this
charms the mind, those the palate only.

8. TERPSICHORE.

Buchanan’s Muse makes live for ever the captains of the martial clime
of Fergus’ sons. Scotstarvet's care confers the same boon on the sacred
bards of that same clime, worthy achievements both: but the latter is
worthier, in proportion as Mars must yield to the Muse, arms to the gown.

9. ERATo.

Why now among the Muses, Scotstarvet, once a member of the great
senate, and still star and ornament of the bench ? Thou shouldst have clung
to Themis and delivered judgments among the purple-robed senators. Be
not ashamed of thy doings. Jove has been known to leave the sky and
visit earth, throwing the thunderbolt away.

nubila ’'! (Nichols' Progr.‚ Ι. 134). Johnston has a rejoinder in No. XXXVIII„ where he
claims Scotland to have been, even to France, a centre os light in old time. Edge was given to
the joke by the coldness of the climate, which Buchanan acknowledges‚ as in the opening of
the De Jurc‚ and in his letter to Tycho Brahe. Ford in Pcrkin Warbeck speaks of Scots as
“hid' in the sogs of their distempered climate”; and Sir John Suckling says: ‘⁴ God and
Nature have placed them in the shade, and they are‘angry with the King of England [Charles
1.] for it ''. A parallel pun has been founded on the resemblance of Knox and Nox, but we
may say, as Camden says about all such sancies: “ Let them be paeking ''.
