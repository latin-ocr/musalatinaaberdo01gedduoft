EPISTLE TO ROBERT BARON. 251

XLI. AD ROBERTUM BARONIUM.

Adspice, Gadiacis quod misi tristis ab undis,
Baroni, plenum rusticitatis opus,

Urbe procul, parvus, nec sat fecundus agellus
Est mihi, saxosis asper ubique iugis.

Hic ego, qui Musis olim Phoeboque litavi,

ancient world, and he transfers the associations of the one locality as lying remote, to describe
the remoteness of his native abode.

6. Bobus aro.] Probably the old “twal-owsen ” plough3 the oxen are made to keep
time, “ numeros discere '’. (No mention of horses as ploughing.)

12. Tesqua bidente domo.] This must mean “trenching ricsky ground''.

15. Flagellatae.] What Burns calls the 0‘ weary flinging—tree,'’ that is, the flail, is here
alluded to—through the incoming of machinery, no longer imposed on the farm-servant of our
