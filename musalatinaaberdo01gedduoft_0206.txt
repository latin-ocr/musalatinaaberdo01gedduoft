TREASURE.

Not in Edition os ’32. Nothing has been discovered os the incident or person here referred to.

ARGUMENT.

Cruel goddess, Thou Fortune‚ trundling human things like a hoop before
thee, why thisjest? Rich yesterday, I am to-day a prisoner; yet Ι never picked
pockets or stretched out pitchy finger-s, or robbed sacred shrines. By all the
powers I swear Ι deserve well of those sovereigns and dukes [dueats] whom 1 ·
found imprisoned, with faces rusty‚ dirty‚ and in coats of silver, or gold, or heavy
copper. Out to the upper air Ι brought them, and golden liberty is to them
worth any money. The vindicator of freedom must be paid : and gold has been
always the reward of heroic liberation; golden reward came because of Hesione,
and likewise for Andromeda when set free. Why should Ι despise what none
despise—-gold ? Golden apple charmed the Queen ofsseauty; Danae, the Hes-
perides, Phryxus, the fate of Polydorus, of Sychaeus, all bear witness to the
magic power of gold. The prey, or prize, came into my hands unawareS.
Rummaging among rubbish 1 found a jar, or vessel, give a clink. Some
grandmother had, of old time, hidden it away, to keep it perhaps from Deu- , .
calion's deluge‚ or took it so far down towards the Styx to pay the exacting i
ferryman. The god of the under-world is a great hoarder. Perhaps it was in- Ι
tended as the sinews of some war. What harm if Pluto (the devil) is bilked of
his gold, or if the fulcrum for war is removed out of the way Ρ My aim is not,
believe me, to buy land, or grounds, or houses; that way trouble lies and ¹
litigatiom nor do Ι wish to attempt merchandise on the sea. My merchan-
(lise will be carrying cup of wine to lip in many a freight of jollity. By s
night, by day I'll drown care in a cup, and ’twill be fun to paint on the table Ι
by red wine a map of the campaigns of the Spaniard. The gifts of fortune ι
Ι will use, ancl not leave them for a cause of torment in division of inheritance 1'
by tierce‚ by moiety‚ by twelfths‚ and so on. These pains I'll prevent, pre· l
scient of the future; no lawyer shall grow fat while the (lcfrauded infant ff
screams for hunger in the cradle, nor shall any widow buy a ncw husband with ’ ἶ
my old gear: my heir shall bc a Boniface or Polydamnus. Κ
