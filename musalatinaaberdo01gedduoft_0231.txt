But alas for human enjoyments! the rose soon welks and wsthers, and in
bidding farewell to our youthful pastimes, Ι am forced also to leave my natal
soil. Twice Ι have crossed the sky-compeering Alps and visited Tiber and
the Po. France has given me hospitality twice two lustres (i.e.‚ two decades
of years), and made me a husband and a sire. Not even Ulysses has
wandered so far; and now Ι return to Caledonia's strand impaired in vigour
and unlike what Ι was. Heaven has blessed me with children to the
number of thirteen ; and twice have Ι wedded‚ but not from one nation each
time, and so Ι count myself doubly an old man. You, too, remaining
faithful to your fatherland, have grown old at home. Grim death may
be delayed, but not old age. But yet there are consolations, and our ills
bring boons compensating. Counsel is the privilege of old men, and with
counsel there comes honour; but war by its trumpet summons forth the
young; while old men sit at the fireside and recount or record warlike deedS.
If chivalry to a young lady makes a demand, snowy locks will give exempti0n‚
where the young must obey the call. WVine is not good for a youth ε old age,

< like Cato's‚ can recreate itself with the pure beverage. Even the weaknesses

of old rnen are frailties due to age. Thus I find compensations as we draw near
the tomb, but to meet you, wedderburn‚ is an elixir of life, potent as Medea's
to recreate old Aeson. What time Ι recall old days with you, youth again
returns.
