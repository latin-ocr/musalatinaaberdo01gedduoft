Yet the ‘⁴ pacific '⁹ king could give graceful expression to his writhing thoughts ε when
the negotiations with Spain for a daughter-in-law did not seem likely to bring about the
restoration of the Palatinate, James said: “He liked not to marry his son [Charles] with a
portion of his daughters [Elizabeth] tears ”3 and, again: “He should be sorrie to welcome
one daughter with a smiling face, and leave his own onely daughter at the same time
weeping and disconsolate''. (Nichols' Progr., 1V. 1120.) The following contemporary
notice is interesting as regards the Bohemian embroglio: “The Spanish marriage project
proceeds. although in the end one party means to deceive the other. Spain, naively, seeks
thereby to delay the succours which might be sent to the King of Bohemia‚ and James finds
in it a good pretext for not declaring himself on the subject of the affairs of Germany.‘' (Von
Raumer, ΙΙ. 243.) The result was that on ἐξ of September, 1622, Heidelberg fell, and Tilly
was master os the splendid Palace, with its treasures and Library, of the Elector Palatine.

ARGUMENT.

Can the city of the Neckar make appeal by pen to Britain ? All ways
are blocked by troops under the Imperial Eagles. But yet we may try : the
loss of paper is a small loss. From a prison Hypermnestra made her appeal :
she, indeed, for love; but Ι for life. Dangers encircle me: Scylla on this
hand, Charybdis on that. 1 arn like to Hesione or Andromeda, when
exposed to the fury of raging monsters. My spouse and defendet is away.
A rumour runs that ye, O Heroes of Britain! are coming to the reseue; and
Ι hover betwixt hope and fear. Thousand grounds there are of sear: there
is one of Hope : our cause is the cause of Heaven. ’Tis for you to hasten : the
Neckar is in the grasp of the enemy. The warrior who led a host too late to
help fallen Troy did no good, neither the shepherd who furbished weapons
after the wolf had sacked the fold. But why incite you with such arguments ?
Your own brave hearts and ancient fame should spur you on. 'Tis no
expedition like the Colchian or Trojan, for a golden fleece, or to recover a
frail queen of beauty. 'Tis no contest against British allies, or against the
British standard with its Lilies and Roses twain combined. That is royal
bravery which succours the distressed; and such virtue climbs the stars.

(p. 258) he speaks of the Princess as “ that excellent Lady, whose fortune is so distant from
her merits and virtue ''. Delightful glimpses of the Princess, and the hopes darkening into
fears, hovering around her, in Dr. Donne's letters,pczssim‚ Vol. VI. ofAlford's Edition of Donne;
also his verse Epithalamion, on the marriage of the Princess, Ibid„ p. 550. Two autograph
letters of the Princess Elizabeth to Marie, Countess of Mar, regarding two sons of‘the
Countess in attendance at her Court, were exhibited in the Glasgow Exhibition of 1888 by
Sheriff Erskine Murray. See Scottish Natiomzl Memorials, p. 76. Plura under No. XXXVI.
