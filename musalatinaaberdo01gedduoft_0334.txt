XLIX. LAMENT OF SOPHIA HAY, LADY MELGUM, ΟΝ
ΤΗΕ DEATH OF HER HUSBAND.

This and the following poem (as also XCIII. in Vol. 11.) deal with the tragic event con-
temporary with Johnston‚ which appalled by its suddenness and mystery the north of Scodand,
and still remains a dark tradition in the memories of the northern Scottish peasantry,——the
Burning of Frendraught. The ruined tower, bearing this fated name, is or was lately visible,
grim and gaunt, in the parish of Forgue, and here, where the tragedy took place, was the
castle which formed the northern seat of the powerful Crichton family, a house that rose so
high as to ally itself with royalty, the Princess Margaret, daughter of James ΙΙ. of Scotland‚
having married the third Lord Crichton. The northern domains of the family embraced
three parishes‚ Forgue, Aberchirder, and Inverkeithney (R. Chambers, D. A„ ΙΙ. 79), but the
estate of Frendraught 1 had passed through many previous possessors.

Into the feud between the Houses of Huntly and Frendraugffl, and the series of events
culminating in the ‘⁶ Burning of the Tower‚“ it would exceed our limits to enter at any length,
but the following are the chief outstanding facts that may be relied on. In 1599 the Gordons
and Crichtons are at peace, for in that year Crichton of Frendraught carries a pennon among
the four “honour-bearers’' at t‘ne creation of the Marquisate of Huntly (Sir George Mac·
kenzie’s Prccedcncy, p. 34). Again, Sir James Crichton, the sixth of Frendraught, was married
to Elizabeth Gordon, who was daughter of the twelfth Earl of Sutherland, and so a cousin
of the House of Huntly. Itis around this lady, Gordon though she was, that a cloud of
dark suspicion rose in connection with the fire, in which two chiefs of the House of Gordon
perished.

The origin of the quarrel was in the slaughter by the Crichtons of William Gordon of
Rothiemay (see No. XCIII. of Vol. 11. ι “De Gulielmo Gordonio caesis‚'' etc., Dclit.‚ 1. p. 613),
the first outcome of which was a huge fine imposed on the Crichtons; then followed the inci-
dent whereby the son of the slain man, as also the son of the chieftain of the House of
Gordon, who exacted the fine, were induced to accept hospitality and pass a night at the castle

¹ Oldest spelling seems to be Fertindrauch (Regist. Momm), probably containing the
Celtic “ feart ’' :strength ; then by assimilation Fernyndrauch (Ragman's Roll, and H. Laing's
Scals, 1. 309, 11. 386). The oldest possessors were, no doubt, Celtic, and bore the name of
the place, Ferendrach ; from these it passed by female heirs first to Frasers, then to Dunbars,
thereafter to the Crichtons, who held it from 1493 to 1698. The subsequent possessors were
the Morisons of Bognie, who still own the land of the fated tower. (See Rev. William
Temple’s St. Margaret's Church, Forguc, which contains an interesting recension of the local
history.)
