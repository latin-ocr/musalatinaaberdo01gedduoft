viii PREFATORY NOTE.

Leeches, David VVedderburn, Rector of Grammar School,

Patrick Dun, and the two lesser Johnstons, one William, the
brother of Arthur, and the other a kinsman, John Johnston,
afterwards professor at St. Andrews, but even then styling him-
self “ Abredonensis ''. The poems of the latter were, with those
of Wedderburn, honoured with a place in the Delz‘tiae of 1637,
and, besides being curious, are interesting historically as dealing
largely with Scottish chiefs and incidents in Scottish history.

In this latter volume, when it is reached, there may also
appear any Biographical Sketches of the Aberdeen Latin Poets

as a whole, including, in a more mature and complete form than ·

is at present feasible, that of Arthur Johnston.1

The above series of three volumes would exhibit the “ Musa
Latina Aberdonensis” in tolerably complete form, in so far as
the secular or non-religious verse is concerned. It would not
embrace the sacred poems or translations from the Scriptures
emanating from various of these writers, and particularly from
Arthur Johnston. For the inclusion of these a fourth volume
would be required, and the propriety of such an addition may be
left over meantime as a question for the future to determine.

In issuing this volume, the Editor feels regret that at this
distance of time the occasion and purpose of several of these
poems remain obscure and undetermined. While he has suc-
ceeded in unravelling the more important of the cruces which
they present, there are various of the minor poems to which
there is no clue, and, at this distance of two centuries and a half,

¹ For the benefit‚ however, of the general reader, it has been thought
proper to prefix meantime a short outline of his life, and for this purpose one
of the earliest that was ever issued, and which seems fairly accurate, viz„
Benson's biography of him, is included in the present volume.
