TO WILLIAM ALEXANDER, EARL Ol? STIRLING. 219

XXXV. TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS LORD, WILLIAM ALEX-
ANDER, EARL oF STIRLING, VIscoUNT OF CANADA‚ AND
SECRETARY To THE K1No.

This poem (like the fifth Eclogue of Leochaeus‚ or John Leech) is in honour of the
famous Earl of Stirling, whose name figures so largely in the literary as well as politica!
history of Johnston's time. Among the estimates of his character, a very notable one is that
given by Scotstarvet in his ‘⁶ Staggering State,'‘ etc. (pp. 72-3), and another by Sir Thomas
Urquhart, in his “ Jewel ⁹⁹. He died in London, February 12, 1640, on which event Spalding

¹ has a quaint pathetic remark (Ι. p. 264). Plura in Masson’s Drummond,· and Gordon's

Scots Affairs (Sp. Cl.)‚ 11. 87. The “ nunc dimittis ” of Professor Masson is : ‘⁴ There he lies
[in Stirling Church] the second-rate Scottish sycophant of an inglorious despofism, and the
author of a large quantity offluent and stately English verse, which no one reads”. Un-
doubtedly his verse is very “ dreich,'' and King James thought his Pegasus a jolting colt, for
he rallied Alexander on his “hard-hammered words, fitter to be used upon his minerallis”.
(Rogers’ Memorials, 1. p. 48.) On the per contra side, Andrew Ramsay (on whom see Vol.
11.‚ No. CVI.) has in his ‘⁶ Miscellanea'’ a laudatory parallel in Elegiacs between this Earl
of Stirling and Demosthenes! Thomas Dempster gives him a place among Scotsmen of
note in his Histor. Eccl. All tributes to him, however, are pale beside that of Sir John
Davies of Hereford (Rogers’ Memorials‚ Ι. p. 53), or that of Michael Drayton, in his Elegies,
coupling “him of Menstrie'’ with “him of Hawthornden''.—Portrait of Wm. Alexander, in
volume entitled Nova scotia (Bann. Club), where is also a Biography of him claiming descent
from an Allaster, sprung from Donald, one of the lords of the Isles. Malicious epitaph on
him, in Epitaphs (Glasgow, 1834), p. 359.

ARGUMENT.

Sad was the day when Alexander of Menstrie entered the Court-circle,

τ deserting Phoebus and the Muses. A chieftain of Poets then said to the poetic

art: ‘⁴ Farewess, and for ever,’‘ and hung up his lyre no longer strung. As soon
as he of Menstrie saw the Thames‚ he became a confidant of the throne, but Ι
wish he had withdrawn thence to other, though far ruder, elimes. Even in
this bleak land of Scotia the Muses can live. So Naso lived in Scythia, and
Orpheus in cold Thrace. The Court is a clime unfavourable to pensive Elegiae
song. ’Tis like the abode of Circe, imposing spells of silence, but the voice of
the poet of Menstrie should not be silent while Menstrie lives. The voice of
