ARGUMENT.

Do you mark on my head and brow the snows of age and its feebleness
creeping on? Time, changing all things, changes me also, and even studies t
that once pleased, please no more, and cares and peevishness are apt to ⁴ ἓ
supplant hilarity. To cure these ills, I try to recall old times, and hence you ,
recur often to my thoughts. .Twin spirits once were we, with one ardour ,
burning to climb Parnassus. Buoyed alost, Ι showed the way and would
sometimes chide your modest delay. Like Daedalus we were and Icarus: J
only my fate was worse than Daedalus's; he reached his bourne, but Phoebus ,
warns me off from the heights of my ambition. Your fate is better than that
of Icarus: he got drowned‚ but you have reached the summit, and have left
your guide far behind, like Maro, or Hora-ce, or Naso surpassing each his .’
master, So Apelles’ 'prentice-hand outstripped his master; and the pilot
Tiphys and the charioteer Automedon outshone their brilliant teachers. But j
no jealousy was indulged by me. Far be livicl envy from my mind,just as ,
it was far from Pylades and Orestes, Pirithous and Theseus, and'other
famous pairs of well-knit friends. Our mutual affection was lit up by Apollo, {
and our haunts were in a certain heath-covered mountain, once clothed with ’
woodS. Streams too we visited and gave to them Parnassian names, and we
enjoyed the beauty and glory of the world, and the seasons as they rolled.
