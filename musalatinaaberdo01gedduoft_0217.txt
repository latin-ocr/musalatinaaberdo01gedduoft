CONDOLENCE WITH BISHOP PAT. FORBES. 175

XXVII. ELEGY ADDRESSED TO THE REVEREND PRE-
LATE, PATRICK FORBES, BISHOP OF ABERDEEN,
WHEN HE WAS MOURNING A BROTHER’S DEATH.¹

The “good bishop,'' who was also Laird of Corse or Barony of O'Neal,
was born in 1564 in Coull of Leochel Cushnie3 minister of Keith, 1610-1618‚
became bishop in 1618, and died on Easter eve, March 28, in 1635. He was
the founder of a school of learning whence issued the most notable group of
theologians in that or any century in Scotland‚ and his life belongs to the history
of his country. His genealogy, as descended from the third son of the second
Lord Forbes, and his acts and letterS‚ are fully detailed in the memorial
volume of the Funerals, etc„ reprinted by the Spottiswood Club. Plura in
Dr. Grub, Eccl. Hist„ 11.311; Dempster, I. 1293; Collections (Spalding Club),
pp. 167, 600, 607; also sarcastic life by James Bruce in Eminent Men of
Aberdeen. The bishop's own line died out, but the lines survived of three of
his brothers, viz„ William, the Dantzig merchant, who purchased Craigievar;
another, John, who was minister at Alford and thereafter at Delft‚ in Holland‚
and was father of Patrick Forbes, Bishop of Caithness ; and a third, the ances-
tor of the Earls of Granard, in Ireland. In Monteith's leeater of Mortality

, (see Select Biogr. (Wodrow Soc.), Ι. pp. 5, 30) is found the full inscription

on his tomb, now in the South Transept of St. Machar’s Cathedral, Old

Aberdeen.

He preached a great discourse in Assembly of 1616, and again (from
Ezra, vii. 23) in Assembly of 1618. Regarding his death we have two con-
temporary accounts, giving details of this learned theologian’s last hours,
one by Spalding, the other by his son Dr. John Forbes, from the latter of

1Τ he bishop and the poet were distantly related. Johnston's mother was a daughter of
the seventh Lord Forbes, and the bishop was descended from an earlier Lord Forbes, common
ancestor of both. The bishop’s father was William Forbes, Laird of Corse, and his mother

was Elizabeth‚ daughter of Strachan of Thornton in the Mearns. (Note in Gardyne's Garden,
