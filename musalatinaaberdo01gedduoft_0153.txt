HIS LAWSUIT AT MALINES. 115

XV. TO THE SAME, ON THE ADJOURNMENT OF THE
CASE AT LAW.

(See remarks on XIII. and XIV.)

ARGUMENT.

Du Fief, my fears have come true. A tempest has burst on me, when
fondly hoping to be in port. Ι am swept out to sea, out of sight of land. Ι
bend to the decree of the Powers Divine‚ but that does not prevent my weep-
ing and complaining. My case resembles Ovid's among the Getae. I have
all his miseries, though Ι provoked not a Caesar's rage nor saw sights that were
too heinous to be seen. The winter of the Getae was child's play 3 my struggle
is with a Rufus, with a soldier quick in quarrel. Ovid, if he were to study
my case, would think little of his Pontic sufferings. Through thee, High
Priest of Themis, I hoped to emerge from this sea of troubles. Aid thou a
humble member of the tuneful band. Arion's dolphin in the sky shows blazon
of twice five stars‚ and all for having saved a bard. Such translation I hope
will corne to thee late in life's evening; but let thine aid corne quick and early.
