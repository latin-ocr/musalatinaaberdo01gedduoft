TO WILLIAM HERBERT, EARL OF PEMBROKE. 215

XXXIV. TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS EARL OF PEMBROKE,
UPON HIS [JOHNSTON'S] RETURN TO COURT.

(See also No. XCVI. in Vol. ΙΙ.)

This poem exhibits an allegorical description of Court Life and its dangers under figure of
a voyage at sea. William Herbert, Third Earl (Lord of VViston), nephew of Sir Philip Sidney,
was Lord Chamberlain‚ 1615-1625‚ as well as Chancellor of the University of Oxford (1617), and
died in 1630. The Fourth Earl‚ his brother Philip, became also Lord Chamberlain, and died in
1650. It is the former who is meant, as the poem appears in the Parcrga of 1632, and Caspar
Barlaeus (see XLVIII.) has poems likewise in honour of William. The Fourth Earl was the
Pembroke who had such a tortuous course in the civil war, long subsequent to Johnston's
death. [Johnston's friend, the first of these, by some taken as the W. H. of Shakspere's
sonnets, has an English encomium in Mirrour of Majcstie‚ No. 22, also ibid„ p. 124.
His name is frequent in the jousts and masques os King James' time.]

ARGUMENT.

After long roaming‚ Fate brings me back to Court—a sea of many
perplexities—with Syrtes and rocks of alluring Sirens, and all the dangers
of the Deep. There blow tempestuous winds, and many a gallant ship goes
down. In Southern Hadriatic Seas ifyou are shipwrecked‚ there is a rivalry
who shall help most with wine or food, and fire and warmth. In other and
barbarian elimes it is otherwise: there they gloat over the missortunes of
the shipwrecked‚ and point the finger of scorn. Yet, when a grand praetorian
ship goes down, the humble pinnace will often slip safely into port. Bellero-
phon( failed to climb the sky, yet his steed Pegasus is among the stars.
Helle was drowned in the Hellespont, but Helle’s golden ram that bore her
reached the Colchian strand. ’Tis this ram's descendants, by my troth‚ that
still wear the golden fleece, sheepish mentally. These enjoy smiling seas and
favouring breezes, under happy stars· But as for us, wind and tide, and
sea and stars‚ contend against us; not Ulysses in Homer had so many ills
to bear, nor Pyrocles' vessel in the romance of [Sir Philip] Sidney, the glory

1 ofyour line. Most potent Pembroke, direct my bark in these uncanny waters,
ἰ and be my protector and Maecenas.
