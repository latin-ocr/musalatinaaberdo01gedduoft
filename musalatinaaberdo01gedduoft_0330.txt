XLVIII. ΟΝ BARLAEUS.¹

The same [Gaspar] who wrote the commendator-y verses on Johnston’s poems which
appeared above (p. 1) as the opening poem. The Latin poems of Barlaeus, here extolled,
appeared at Leyden in 1630-1. This eulogy of a Dutch rival is somewhat like Horace's tribute
to Pindar, showing by its elegance‚ while disclaiming rivalry, how strong a rival the eulogist

could prove.²
ARGUMENT.

O that Ι had the wing of Daedalus or the pinion of Mercury, or Perseus, or
Pegasus, or that which wafted Ganymede. Forthwith should 1 speed over sea,
and land me on Batavian shores, where I should sit and gaze on Barlaeus’
countenance or prostrate myself at his feet. I should hang on his lips as on a
siren's tongue‚ and drink in the accents with rejoicing ear. Heinsius’ son, and
Baudius, and Grotius have each their gifts3 yet Barlaeus unites these gifts and
excels them all. He draws me as by a philtre or a spell : like as amber attracts
straws, or the magnet iron—weights, or the polestar the magnet. The Waal and
the Rhine have echoed the strains of Castalia. Once on a time Ι loved to strike
the Latian lyre, and hoped, as a bard, to win applause. But when the trum-
pet-note of Barlaeus sounded, my Muse grew silent. The grasshopper chirps
poorly in the thickets when the lark lifts his matin song. My poems should
have been sent not to press but to the shades of perpetual night. The
Batavian bard has extinguished the rays of Johnston's Muse. He is heir to
all the qualities of the antique song, the Mantuan’s majesty, Ovid's grace,
Tibullus' elegance, Horace's lyric power, the rasping lampoons of Archilochus,
and Martial's wit. I believe now in metempsychosis. Jupiter has transfused
into Barlaeus the spirit and art of all the antique bards.

¹ Cf. James Bruce's odd note, from Bayle, p. 187, as to Barlaeus and his hallucinations
(Emincnt Men ofAbcrdccu, cta).

‘-'The two poets‚ Johnston and Barlaeus, seem to have sympathised as to contemporary
themes; for in the Heroica of Barlaeus (p. 60) we find a cognate lament to that of Johnston
in No. VIII. over the fortunes os the Palatinate :-—-

“ Ecce Palatinae libertas saucia terrae
Poscit opem‚” ete.‚

and, in the same vein as Johnston‚
‘⁴ Victorique Nicer fasces submitteret Istro ”

(ι’.ε., Danube and Vienna victorious over the Neckar). Barlaeus has also a long Latin poem in
honour of William Herbert, “ Comitem Pembrochiae‚'’ whom, like Johnston in XXXIV„ ete.‚
he praises as “Grande Poetarum columen ’'.
