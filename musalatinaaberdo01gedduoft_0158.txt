XVII. THANKFUL ACKNOWLEDGMENTS TO THE
COURT OF MALINES.

Bright and spirited little poem, catching up the tone and nautical imagery of No. XIV.

ARGUMENT.

victorious now, we have eseaped the dangers of the Juridie Sea, and
come to offer our homage at your feet. Gifts I have none but the offerings of
a grateful mind—Apollo’s notes and numbers. I was like Andromeda,

exposed to monstrous dangers, and ye have acted to me the part of a
gallant Perseus.
