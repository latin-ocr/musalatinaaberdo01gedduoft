Disiicit, afflictis porrigit ille manum.
Nec sua, quae miseris succurrit, praemia desunt
Virtuti; haec multis stravit ad astra viam.
Intulit Inachiden caelo subducta periclis
Andromede3 merces 11366 pietatis erat. 60
Hic nitet et Delphin, te qui servavit, Arion,
Et pia, quae Phryxum per mare vexit, ovis.
Nant gemini iuxta pisces: Euphratis in undis
Hic Veneris, nati portitor ille fuit.
Forsan et hinc aliquis, suspectans sidera, dicet,
Has caelo imposuit salva Nicrina faceS.
Hic Verius, rutilos 11116 Oxfordius ignes
Explicat ; Essexi nec procul inde iubar.
Persea Gerardus, Geminos vicinia Graii,
Herculis exstinguent astra Richaea faces. 70
Digna minus tantis si fors Nicrina videtur

67. Verius, Oxfordius.] The ‘⁶ mullet’' or “ staff in the shield of the Veres may have
suggested this astronomica] sally. 'There were two Veres, brothers, who were engaged in
these wars: Sir Francis, grandson of the 15th Earl of Oxford (1554—1608), the hero of Nieu-
port and Ostend (see interesting sketch in Motley's thlzerlands, 111. p. 69, and glimpse of,
in Cecil’s Letters to Carew (Camd. Soc.)‚ p. 94), and his younger brother, Horace, afterwards
Lord Vere (1565-1635). The latter, besides being present also at Nieuport and the defence of
Ostend, took part in the early scenes of the Thirty Years' VVar (Carlyle's Frederick, Book
111. chap. xvi.; James Grant’s Hepbztrn, p. 12; Dr. Donne's W'orks, VI. pp. 379, 389), and
measured swords with Tilly in 1623. Not being sufficiently supported by James 1.‚ he had
to return not inglorious, though unsuccessful. Our Scottish soldier, Alex. Lesley, Earl of
Leven, served in Holland under Vere (Pinkerton's Icon. Scot.).

68. Essexi.] Robert Devereux, Third Earl of Essex (1592-1646), son of the ill-fated
Essex who figures prominently in the questions as to Bacon, Lord Verulam, and who came
to the block in the latter days of Queen Elizabeth. This third earl raised a troop‚ and joined
Lord Oxford in 1620 to assist the Elector Palatine (Niehols' Progr., IV. 610, 611 n.; Walter
Yonge's Diary (Camd. Soc. )‚ pp. 32—3). He is the Essex of the Parliamentary Army in the
Civil War. An interesting letter of Essex is found in Green’s Lives (6·17), in which, ad-
dressing the Long Parliament, he pleads consideration for the Princess, “ for whose sake I
had the honour first to bear arms ⁷'.

69. Gerardus.] A warrior, Sir Gerard Herbert, is a defendet of Heidelberg (Rapin’s
Hist. osEngl., II. p. 216 note).

69. Graii.] On Graius (Sir Andrew Grey), see No. VI. At first sight one might be apt
to assume this as the ‘⁴ Graius Hercules,” but the edition of 1632 places a comma between.

70. Richaea.] Sir Charles Rich, brother to the Earl of WVarwick‚ was one of the
champions‚ and along with him were “Sir James Heyes, Knevet, Hume, and Heiborn’⁷
(i.e., Hepburn).—-Ar. Wilson‚ History, p. 218.
