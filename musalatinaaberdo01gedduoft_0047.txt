III. N0131Liss1Mo ET AMPLISSIMO V1Ro, D. IOANNI SCOTO SCOTO-
TARVATIO, EQum, CANCELLARIAE ScoTIAE DIRECTORI, CON-
SILIARIO Recio, AMico suo OPTIMO.

Scote‚ Caledonii decus immortale Senatus,
Consule quo poterat Roma vetusta regi:
Scote‚ suas a quo Pallas non abnuat artes,
Virtutem Virtus discere, iura Themis:
Scote‚ cohors quem sacra patrem Phoebusque magistrum,
Quem Maecenatem Castalis unda vocet.
-Scote‚ mori qui nostra vetas, cui serviet uni
Ingenii nobis quicquid et artis inest z
Haec tibi Ionstonus magni leve pignus amoris
Nuncupat‚ innocuis ludicra texta iocis. 10
Dum patriae premitur curis, dum nubila mens est,
Materiem risus, si legis, ista dabunt.
Accipe; nee plausum populi, nec praemia quaero3
Sat vates, veniam si mereantur, habent.

¹The tage for anagram, of which this is an example, was at its height in Johnston's
time. His friend, Drummond, thought little of them, and said: “ They are the most idle
study in the world of learning '' (Ancram Correspondence,11. 518). Yet Puritan and High
Churchman alike delighted in them; Charles Ῑ., according to Balsour’s Μευιοὶνς, finding
comfort on the eve of his execution in resolving “Carolus Rex '‘ into “cras ero lux'’; and
Prynne hurling at “ William Laud ’' the anagram “ Will I mad(e) Law ⁷’ (Prynne, Camd. Soc.‚
p. 55). The anagram has figured much in Heraldic mottoes: as cg. virens, anagrarn of
“ 1rvens,” old spelling os the Irvines; and we shall find it a key to unlock several otherwise
obscure titles of these poems. It was the age of Thomas Fuller who gloried in the kindred
Impresa “ neither so apparent that every rustic mIght understand them, nor so obscure that
they needed an Oedipus to interpret thern '' (Nichols' Progr. os James I., I. 172).
