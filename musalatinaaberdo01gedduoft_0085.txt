SATIRE ΟΝ EGLISHEM. 51

TOMB OF ONOPORDUS.

[ONOPORDUS = Dr. EGLrsHEM.]

This jeu d'esprit is included in the ⁸⁴ Delitiae '' as if Johnston's, but in the earlier
‘⁴ Parerga ‘⁷ of 1632 it is given in italics, and with the words which Scotstarvet in re-printing
the poem had somehow dropped ε “ Auctore Daniele Tileno '’. Tilenus, a Silesian‚ famous as
a theologian, was an intimate friend and colleague of Johnston at Sedan. Plura, concerning

Tilenus in Volume IL, under the Epigrammata.

ARGUMENT.

Hercules, at the bidding of a jealous stepmother‚ subdued monsters,
and vanquished the water-snake of Lerna with the help of Iolaus’ fire-iron.
Onopordus, who has bred many asinine monsters in the cavern of a bad
heart, never dreamt that a Hercules still lives, and 5ο dared to stab Apollo
through Buchanan's loins, and insuit the Aonian Muses. With one switch
of the Arthurian tail he is laid low. No need here of Herculean club or
arrowe, or Iolaus’ flames. The ja'wbone of an ass once slew thousands:
to-day the tail of one ‘⁴ She-Bear ’' slays a thousand asses.
