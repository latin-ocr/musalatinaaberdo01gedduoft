A portrait of Paul Menzies, of Kinmundy, dated 1620, by Jameson, is in the Hall of
Marischal College. Patron of Raban, whom he and Bishop Pat. Forbes invited to Aberdeen.
Friend of Jameson, and sponsor to Jameson’s child. He was one of fifty-four gentlemen

Glimpses of him are got also in Bulloch's Jameson; Bruce's Eminent Men (p. 136) ; Lundie‘s
Pocms, pp. 10-12. Two pathetic entries are found in Spalding concerning him, one of his own
death, and the other of his son’s by drowning, Ι. 230; ΙΙ. 88. Epitaph upon Kinmundy in
Collection of Effitufflzs, p. 141, Glasgow‚ 1834; and see Notes and Querics‚ Ι. p. 52.
