118 PARERGA.

XVI. ELEGIAC POEM TO THE RIGHT REVEREND AND
RIGHT HONOURABLE PHILIP JONART‚ COUNSEL-
LOR IN THE COURT OF MALINES.

(On,¹ Jonart see No. XVIII.)

ARGUMENT.

All nature now is smiling: sea, sky, stars‚ and earth, with all that Phoe-
bus' eye beholds. Ι alone am miserable, an exile involved in lawsuits, and
these too endless. Lend help: soon help will be in vain. My ship is full of
leaks, and my substance melts away as in a consumption. All the while my
adversary, the soldier, enjoys his repose on his native diff, crying out
“ Hurra ! ” as if victorious. 1 am guilty of no crime against Phoebus, Ι stole
no fite from his ear, yet I suffer like a Prometheus. Come to my aid, as
Hercules did to Prometheus. Fabius saved Rome by his cautious delay: but
my cause is lost thereby.
