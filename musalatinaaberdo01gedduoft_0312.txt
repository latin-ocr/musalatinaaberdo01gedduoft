XLV. PANTLEMON'S COMPLAINT TO THE COUNCIL
AGAINST BUCAULUS.

The key to this poem has not been discovered. Lauder (p. 38 of Musae Sacrae), in his
account of Johnston's miscellaneous poems, identifies Pantlemon with the writer himself,
but the personal incident underlying does not easily appear.

ARGUMENT.

Benign Council, superior in dignity to the Latian Senam, read and com-
miserate. From a prison-cell Ι write, where Parliament House adjoins the
noisy Court of Law. Benachie and Gadie know familiarly my woes. Ι had
a stepmother, and to her Bucaulus administered love philtres: while poison
of aconite was given to my decrepit sire. He swelled and died. The
adulterer became her sponse, by an unlawful wedlock consummated beyond

the land's hosdem, with a rogue for priest and a dull tavern for a church. The'

adulteress then slipped into the property, enjoying two tierces of the estate,
and BucauluS, taking me into lawsuit after lawsuit, wasted my ancestral
possessions. Worse loss than that, my good name was undermined and
ruined; and Ι was made an outlaw. This roused my bile3 and I confess 1
girded my sword on my thigh, the thing that now has wrought me barm.
Yet Orestes avenged even on a mother his father's blood; Menelaus took
penalty for his wife's abduction. But of such acts Ι stopped short, obedient
to the laws, and simply gave the ill-doers a fright; for no violence, either burn-
ing or laying waste, has come from me. Any fault Ι committed was pardoned
by King charles, but this rogue laughs at royal diplomas. The hut where I
was hiding he surrounds with an armed band of fellows who were once them-
selves proscribed. In the scrimmage a woman is shot, and the noise broke
my slumber. Ι darted up, rushed out and said: “Here is Pandemon, ye
are welcome to lead him prisoner, yea, cut his throat with your weapons now
stained with maiden’s blood '’. They confined me, these rogues of proscribed
men, in a neighbouring castle; then Ι am taken to the city prison here. I
bear the punishment, but the insulting wrong is borne byyon, O senators of
justice, who are thus made fools of, as is also the sceptre of your Grampian-
born imperial Jove [Charles I.]. Bring him to trial, the ignoble rogue; if

this fellow dies not, Ι should not sear to face grim death, where there would
be no retribution.
