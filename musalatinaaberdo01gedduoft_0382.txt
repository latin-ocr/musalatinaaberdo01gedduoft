establishing in Aberdeen an Archaeological Museum, representing
more especially the antiquities of the North Eastern District of
Scotland. The Town Council “ remitted the matter to the
consideration of the Lord Provost’s Committee for a Report,
with powers to confer with the Art Gallery Committee on the
subject, and also in regard to a suggestion made by the deputation
as to holding a preliminary Loan Exhibition of antiquities at an
early date''. Thereafter the Lord Provost's Committee remitted
the matter for Report to a small Sub-Committee: Baillie Crombie,
Convener. Up to 16th November last, when the newly elected
Town Council appointed its Committees, this Sub-Committee had
presented no Report, and as the Lord Provost’s Committee has
not been reappointed for the current year, it would seem that
further consideration of the subject by the Town Council is de-
ferred indefinitely. The Council of the New Spalding Club regret
this postponement of a movement which bade fair to further the
progress of Archceological study in the North Eastern Counties.

As the Special Committees on Church Records, on Burgh
Records, etc.. have now completed the investigation of the
different fields entrusted to them, the Council propose in future
to limit the Standing Committees to three (each having power to
form Sub-Committees) :—

I. The Business Committee: to manage the finance and
general business of the Club.

II. The Editorial Committee: to decide on the works to
be issued by the Club, to select the editors, and to
regulate all literary and artistic details.

II. The Archaeology Committee : to investigate the general
Archaeology of the North Eastern Counties‚ and to
continue negotiations for the formation of an Archaeo-
logical Museum in Aberdeen.
